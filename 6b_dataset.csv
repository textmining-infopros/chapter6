gamma-ray bursts detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE)
on board the {\it Compton} Gamma Ray Observatory. We show evidence that
individual bursts are time-asymmetric on all time scales tested, from a time
scale shorter than that of pulses which compose GRBs to a time scale similar to
a greater envelope that contains these pulses. We also find bursts which
manifest significant asymmetry only on time scales comparable to the duration
of burst, and bursts for which no clear asymmetry on any time scale is present.
The sense of the asymmetry is that bursts and/or component structures rise in a
shorter time than they decay. We also find that our whole sample of bursts
taken together is time- asymmetric, in that there are significantly more bursts
and pulses where the rise is more rapid than the decay, on all time scales
tested and for all energy bands tested. When our whole GRB sample is binned at
64-ms and integrated over all BATSE energies, the statistical significance is
at the 6 $\sigma$ level. Models that predict time-symmetry are therefore
excluded.

  Relativistic Wind on External Matter","  Sudden collapse of a compact object, or coalescence of a compact binary, can
generate an unsteady relativistic wind that lasts for a few seconds. The wind
is likely to carry a high magnetic field; and its Lorentz factor depends on the
extent to which it is 'loaded' with baryons. If the Lorentz factor is $\sim
100$, internal dissipation and shocks in this wind produce a non-thermal
gamma-ray burst, detectable in the range $0.1\MeV \siml E_\gamma \siml
0.1-1\GeV$ out to cosmological distances. The cooled wind ejecta would
subsequently be decelerated by the external medium. The resultant blast wave
and reverse shock can then give rise to a second burst component, mainly
detectable in the GeV range, with a time delay relative to the MeV burst
ranging from minutes to hours.

  Cosmological Gamma-Ray Bursts","  We discuss several constraints on the properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) at
cosmological distances. First we use the requirement that burst sources must be
optically thin to pair production by photon-photon collisions in order to
produce the observed nonthermal spectra. We derive probability distributions
for the minimum Lorentz expansion factor, the radiation energy, the maximum
baryonic mass, and the maximum surrounding gas density in the events, based on
254 events from the second BATSE catalog. Secondly, the time variabilities of
the bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the
curvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the
requirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently
small to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,
we discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight
bright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose
positional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity
function of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host
galaxy. This probability tends to increase as the width of the GRB luminosity
function increases. However, the allowed width of the GRB luminosity function
is restricted by the number-count statistics of the bursts.

experiment on board of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory are uniformly and
randomly distributed in the sky, with no significant concentration to the
galactic plane or to the galactic center. The strong gamma-ray bursts have an
intensity distribution consistent with a number density independent of distance
in Euclidean space. Weak gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare, indicating that
either their number density is reduced at large distances or that the space in
which they are distributed is non-Euclidean. In other words, we appear to be at
the center of a spherical and bounded distribution of bursters. This is
consistent with the distribution of all objects that are known to be at
cosmological distances (like galaxies and quasars), but inconsistent with the
distribution of any objects which are known to be in our galaxy (like stars and
globular clusters). If the bursters are at cosmological distances then the
weakest bursts should be redshifted, i.e. on average their durations should be
longer and their spectra should be softer than the corresponding quantities for
the strong bursts. There is some evidence for both effects in the BATSE data.
  At this time the cosmological distance scale is strongly favored over the
galactic one, but is not proven. A definite proof (or dis-proof) could be
provided with the results of a search for very weak bursts in the Andromeda
galaxy (M31) with an instrument $ \sim 10 $ times more sensitive than BATSE.
  If the bursters are indeed at cosmological distances then they are the most
luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation known in the universe. At this
time we have no clue as to their nature, even though well over a hundred
suggestions were published in the scientific journals. An experiment providing

  Sources. II. Isotropic Models","  We use Bayesian methods to analyze the distribution of gamma ray burst
intensities reported in the Third BATSE Catalog (3B catalog) of gamma ray
bursts, presuming the distribution of burst sources (``bursters'') is
isotropic. We study both phenomenological and cosmological source distribution
models, using Bayes's theorem both to infer unknown parameters in the models,
and to compare rival models. We analyze the distribution of the time-averaged
peak photon number flux, F, measured on both 64 ms and 1024 ms time scales,
performing the analysis of data based on each time scale independently. Several
of our findings differ from those of previous analyses that modeled burst
detection less completely. In particular, we find that the width of the
intrinsic luminosity function for bursters is unconstrained, and the luminosity
function of the actually observed bursts can be extremely broad, in contrast to
the findings of all previous studies. Useful constraints probably require
observation of bursts significantly fainter than those visible to BATSE. We
also find that the 3B peak flux data do not usefully constrain the redshifts of
burst sources; useful constraints require the analysis of data beyond that in
the 3B catalog (such as burst time histories), or data from brighter bursts
than have been seen by BATSE (such as those observed by the Pioneer Venus
Orbiter). In addition, we find that an accurate understanding of the peak flux
distributions reported in the 3B almost certainly requires consideration of
data on the temporal and spectral properties of bursts beyond that reported in
the 3B catalog, and more sophisticated modeling than has so far been attempted.

sufficient data quality has a simple ``stretched'' exponential shape, F ~
exp[-(t/t_0)^{1/3}], where $t$ is the time measured from the time for the peak
flux of the event, and $t_0$ is a time constant. We study the behaviour of
$t_0$ of both the post-peak and the pre-peak slopes of the average time profile
as a function of the peak brightness range of the burst sample. We found that
the post-peak slope shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts,
while the pre-peak slope hardly changes. Thus dimmer bursts have a different
shape -- they are more asymmetric. This shape-brightness correlation is
observed at a 99.6% confidence level. Such a correlation has a natural
explanation within the pulse avalanche model, which is briefly described.
Complex events, consisting of many pulses are more symmetric and are
intrinsically brighter. Bursts consisting of one or a few pulses are
intrinsically weaker and more asymmetric. For such a correlation to be
observable requires that the luminosity distance distribution of GRBs to be
different from a power-law.

  Potential Distance Discriminator","  Relativistic bulk motion with large Lorentz factors has recently been
inferred for gamma-ray bursts regardless of whether they are of galactic or
cosmological origin. This conclusion results from calculations of internal pair
production transparency in bursts that usually assume an infinite power-law
source spectrum for simplicity, an approximation that is quite adequate for
some bursts detected by EGRET. However, for a given bulk Lorentz factor
\teq{\Gamma}, photons above the EGRET range can potentially interact with
sub-MeV photons in such calculations. Hence it is essential to accurately
address the spectral curvature in bursts seen by BATSE. In this paper we
present the major properties induced in photon-photon opacity considerations by
such spectral curvature. The observed spectral breaks around 1 MeV turn out to
be irrelevant to opacity in cosmological bursts, but are crucial to estimates
of source transparency in the 1 GeV -- 1 TeV range for sources located in the
galactic halo. We find that broad absorption troughs can arise at these
energies for suitable bulk motion parameters \teq{\Gamma}. Such troughs are
probably an unambiguous signature of a galactic halo population, and if
observed by experiments such as Whipple, MILAGRO and GLAST, would provide
powerful evidence that such bursts are not at cosmological distances.

been shown that Lorentz transformations are easily extended in Minkowski space
to address velocities beyond the speed of light. Energy and momentum
conservation fixes the relation between masses and velocities larger than c,
leading to the possible observation of negative mass squared particles from a
standard reference frame. Current data on neutrinos' mass square yeld negative
values, making neutrinos as possible candidates for having speed larger than c.
In this paper, an original analysis of the SN1987A supernova data is proposed.
It is shown that all the data measured in '87 by all the experiments are
consistent with the quantistic description of neutrinos as combination of
superluminal mass eigenstates. The well known enigma on the arrival times of
the neutrino bursts detected at LSD, several hours earlier than at IMB, K2 and
Baksan, is explained naturally. It is concluded that experimental evidence for
superluminal neutrinos was recorded since the SN1987A explosion, and that data
are quantitatively consistent with the introduction of tachyons in Einstein's
equation.

This instrument employed a proportional and scintillation counter to provide
sensitivity to photons in the 2 - 400 keV range, providing a unique opportunity
to characterize the largely unexplored X-ray properties of gamma-ray bursts.
The photon spectra of the Ginga bursts are well described by a low energy
slope, a bend energy, and a high energy slope. In the energy range where they
can be compared, this result is consistent with burst spectral analyses
obtained from the BATSE experiment aboard the Compton Observatory. However,
below 20 keV we find evidence for a positive spectral number index in
approximately 40% of our burst sample, with some evidence for a strong rolloff
at lower energies in a few events. There is a correlation (Pearson's r = -0.62)
between the low energy slope and the bend energy. We find that the distribution
of spectral bend energies extends below 10 keV. The observed ratio of energy
emitted in the X-rays relative to the gamma-rays can be much larger than a few

Field Cameras aboard BeppoSAX, both in gamma-rays and X-rays. With respect to
its fluence (2.6 X 10**-5 erg/s/cm**2 in 50 to 300 keV) it would be in the top
4% of gamma-ray bursts in the 4B catalog (Meegan et al. 1998). The
time-averaged burst spectrum from 2 to 20 and 70 to 650 keV can be well
described by the empirical model of Band et al. (1993). The resulting photon
index above the break energy is exceptionally hard at -1.32 +/- 0.03. An X-ray
afterglow was detected with the narrow-field instruments aboard BeppoSAX 7 h
after the event within the error box as determined with the Wide Field Cameras.
Its peak flux is (1.4 +/- 0.2) X 10**-12 erg/s/cm**2 (2 to 10 keV). The
afterglow decayed according to a power law function with an index of -1.35 +/-
0.03. GRB 980329 is characterized by being bright and hard, and lacking strong
spectral evolution.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were too faint to activate the real-time burst
detection system running onboard the spacecraft. These ""non-triggered"" bursts
can be combined with the ""triggered"" bursts detected onboard to produce a GRB
intensity distribution that reaches peak fluxes a factor of 2 lower than could
be studied previously. The value of the V/Vmax statistic (in Euclidean space)
for the bursts we detect is 0.177 +/- 0.006. This surprisingly low value is
obtained because we detected very few bursts on the 4.096 s and 8.192 s time
scales (where most bursts have their highest signal-to-noise ratio) that were
not already detected on the 1.024 s time scale. If allowance is made for a
power-law distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities, the extended peak flux
distribution is consistent with models in which the redshift distribution of
the gamma-ray burst rate approximately traces the star formation history of the
Universe. We argue that this class of models is preferred over those in which
the burst rate is independent of redshift. We use the peak flux distribution to
derive a limit of 10% (99% confidence) on the fraction of the total burst rate
that could be contributed by a spatially homogeneous (in Euclidean space)
subpopulation of burst sources, such as type Ib/c supernovae. These results
lend support to the conclusions of previous studies predicting that relatively
few faint ""classical"" GRBs will be found below the BATSE onboard detection
threshold.

1806-20 suggest that it is associated with a cluster of giant massive stars
which are enshrouded in a dense cloud of dust. The centre of the best sky
position of the gamma-ray source (Hurley et al. 1999) lies on top of the dust
cloud at only 7 arcsec (~0.5 pc at a distance of 14.5 kpc) from the star
cluster, and 12 arcsec (~0.85 pc) from a Luminous Blue Variable Star (LBV)
which had been proposed to be associated with the SGR (Kulkarni et al. 1995).
The bright cloud of interstellar gas and dust observed with ISO (Infrared Space
Observatory) is probably the birth site of the cluster of massive stars, the
LBV star, and the progenitor of the soft gamma-ray repeater pulsar. The
presence of such a young star formation region is compatible with the current
interpretation of soft gamma-ray repeaters as young neutron stars. The SGR
1806-20 compact source is unlikely to form a bound binary system with any of
the infrared luminous massive stars, since no flux variations in the
near-infrared were detected from the latter in an interval of 4 years.The ISO
observations were made over two epochs, 11 days before and 2 hours after a soft
gamma-ray burst detected with the Interplanetary Network, and they show no
enhanced mid-infrared emission associated to the high energy activity of the

with the energy above 100keV from two bright Gamma-ray bursts detected by the
PHEBUS instrument of the GRANAT orbital observatory. We show that the light
curves of GRB910402 and GRB920723 events present the afterglow emission with
fading fluxes. During our observations ~700s for these gamma-ray bursts the
afterglow emission was fading as the power law of time with indices equal to
-0.70+/-0.04 and -0.60+/-0.05 (at 1sigma confidence level). In both cases just
after the end of the GRB event we observed the energy spectrum of the afterglow
emissions which was softer than the energy spectrum of the main GRB events. The
average photon index of the main GRB event (in 100-800keV range) is equal to
\~1.5. In the beginning of the afterglow emission the energy spectra of both
events correspond to the much softer spectra with the photon index of ~2.5. We
found that the times of abrupt softening of the burst spectra correspond within
statistical errors to the moment when the afterglow emission begins to dominate
over GRB emission. We found that during the afterglow emission of GRB910402 the
statistically significant hardening of its spectra was observed. This is the
first observation of hardening of GRB afterglow emission. Analysis of GRB910402
and its afterglow showed that this GRB source emits during ~700s of our
observations in soft gamma-rays (100-500keV) only ~1.6% of its total energy
released during the main event. For the GRB920723 we found that in afterglow

  for Number Counts and Lensing Statistics","  Recent evidence appears to link gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to star-forming
regions in galaxies at cosmological distances. If short-lived massive stars are
the progenitors of GRBs, the rate of events per unit cosmological volume should
be an unbiased tracer (i.e. unaffected by dust obscuration and surface
brightness limits) of the cosmic history of star formation. Here we use
realistic estimates for the evolution of the stellar birthrate in galaxies to
model the number counts, redshift distribution, and time-delay factors of GRBs.
We present luminosity function fits to the BATSE log N-log P relation for
different redshift distributions of the bursts. Our results imply about 1-2
GRBs every one million Type II supernovae, and a characteristic
`isotropic-equivalent' burst luminosity in the range 3-20 x 1e51 ergs/s (for
H_0=65 km/s/Mpc). We compute the rate of multiple imaging of background GRBs
due to foreground mass condensations in a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter
cosmology, assuming that dark halos approximate singular isothermal spheres on
galaxy scales and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles on group/cluster scales, and are
distributed in mass according to the Press-Schechter model. We show that the
expected sensivity increase of Swift relative to BATSE could result in a few
strongly lensed individual bursts detected down to a photon flux of 0.1
phot/s/cm^2 in a 3-year survey. Because of the partial sky coverage, however,
it is unlikely that the Swift satellite will observe recurrent events (lensed
pairs).

brightness oscillations (NCOs) in a large sample of type-I X-ray bursts

of this source obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer over a 3 year span
from 1996-1999. The data contain 38 bursts, 16 of which show NCOs. We find no
NCOs present when the inferred mass accretion rate of the system is lowest.
Furthermore, we define a measure of the strength of the oscillations and find
that this strength increases with increasing mass accretion rate. This
correlation is particularly evident within bursts detected only a few weeks
apart, and becomes less clear for bursts separated in time by several months to
years. The correlation we find for 4U 1728-34 between the NCOs and the inferred
accretion rate of the system is similar to that found for KS 1731-260 by Muno
et al. (2000), where the NCOs are only present at relatively high mass
accretion rates. However, unlike the case for KS 1731-260, we find an
anti-correlation in the bursts of 4U 1728-34 between the existence of episodes
of photospheric radius expansion and the inferred mass accretion rate of the
system. Moreover, we distinguish between NCOs present in the rise and in the
decay phase of the burst and find that the bursts with NCOs only in the decay
phase occur at intermediate accretion rates, while those with NCOs in both the
rise and the decay phases are concentrated at high inferred mass accretion
rates. We discuss these results in the context of the theory of thermonuclear
bursts and propose intrinsic differences in the neutron stars in KS 1731-260

  Gamma-ray Bursts","  Gamma-ray bursts of short duration may harbor vital clues to the range of
phenomena producing bursts. However, recent progress from the observation of
optical counterparts has not benefitted the study of short bursts. We have
searched for early optical emission from six gamma-ray bursts using the ROTSE-I
telephoto array. Three of these events were of short duration, including GRB
980527 which is among the brightest short bursts yet observed. The data consist
of unfiltered CCD optical images taken in response to BATSE triggers delivered
via the GCN. For the first time, we have analyzed the entire 16 degree by 16
degree field covered for five of these bursts. In addition, we discuss a search
for the optical counterpart to GRB 000201, a well-localized long burst. Single
image sensitivities range from 13th to 14th magnitude around 10 s after the
initial burst detection, and 14 - 15.8 one hour later. No new optical
counterparts were discovered in this analysis suggesting short burst optical
and gamma-ray fluxes are uncorrelated.

very close to the neutron star rotation frequency.

reflects not only the distribution of the energy actually released by the burst
engine, but also the distribution of beaming angles. Using the observed energy
fluences, the detection thresholds and burst redshifts for three burst samples,
I calculate the best-fit parameters for lognormal and power-law distributions
of the apparent total energy. Two of the samples include a small number of
bursts with spectroscopic redshifts, while the third sample has 220 bursts with
redshifts determined by the proposed variability-luminosity correlation. I find
different sets of parameter values for the three burst samples. The Bayesian
odds ratio cannot distinguish between the two model distribution functions for
the two smaller burst samples with spectroscopic redshifts, but does favor the
lognormal distribution for the larger sample with variability-derived
redshifts. The data do not rule out a distribution with a low energy tail which
is currently unobservable. I find that neglecting the burst detection threshold
biases the fitted distribution to be narrower with a higher average value than
the true distribution; this demonstrates the importance of determining and
reporting the effective detection threshold for bursts in a sample.

phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB). In particular we examine the spectral
evolution of GRB 980306 together with the detailed analysis of some other
bursts already presented in the literature (GRB 911118, GRB 910807, GRB 910927
and GRB 970111), and check for the significance of their hardness (i.e.
extremely steep spectral slopes below the $EF_{E}$ peak) by applying different
tests. These bursts, detected by the Burst And Transient Source Experiment
(BATSE) in the $\sim 30$ keV -- 2 MeV energy range, are sufficiently bright to
allow time resolved spectral studies on time intervals of the order of tenths
of a second. We discuss the hard spectra of these bursts and their evolution in
the context of several non--thermal emission models, which all appear
inadequate to account for these cases. The extremely hard spectra, which are
detected in the early part of the BATSE light curve, are also compared with a
black body spectral model: the resulting fits are remarkably good, except for
an excess at high energies (in several cases) which could be simply accounted
for by the presence of a supra--thermal component. The findings on the possible
thermal character of the evolving spectrum and the implications on the GRB
physical scenario are considered in the frameworks of photospheric models for a
fireball which is becoming optically thin, and of Compton drag models, in which
the fireball boosts ""ambient"" seed photons by its own bulk motion. Both models,
according to simple estimates, appear to be qualitatively and quantitatively
consistent with the found spectral characteristics, although their possible
caveats are discussed.

SGR1806-20 has been studied by means of four XMM-Newton observations carried
out in the last two years, the latter performed in response to a strong
sequence of hard X-ray bursts observed on 2004 October 5. The source was caught
in different states of activity: over the 2003-2004 period the 2-10 keV flux
doubled with respect to the historical level observed previously. The long term
raise in luminosity was accompanied by a gradual hardening of the spectrum,
with the power law photon index decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, and by a growth of
the bursting activity. The pulse period measurements obtained in the four
observations are consistent with an average spin-down rate of 5.5x10e-10 s/s,
higher than the values observed in the previous years. The long-term behavior
of SGR1806-20 exhibits the correlation between spectral hardness and spin-down
rate previously found only by comparing the properties of different sources
(both SGRs and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars). The best quality spectrum (obtained on
6 September 2004) cannot be fitted by a single power law, but it requires an
additional blackbody component (kT=0.79 keV, R_BB = 1.9 (d/15 kpc)^2 km),
similar to the spectra observed in other SGRs and in Anomalous X-ray Pulsars.
No spectral lines were found in the persistent emission, with equivalent width
upper limits in the range 30-110 eV. Marginal evidence for an absorption
feature at 4.2 keV is present in the cumulative spectrum of 69 bursts detected

z=3.37 for GRB 030323), these two GRBs span about an order of magnitude in
fluence, thus sampling distinct regions of the GRB luminosity function. The

Evidence for a very weak and long duration component associated with these
events in the two 1 s counters of the GRBM (40-700 keV and >100 keV) is found.
It starts a few tens of seconds before the burst and continues for about 30 s
after the burst. The overall hardness of this component is comparable with that
of the event itself. The detection of a signal before the onset time and the
similar hardness are consistent with an interpretation of the long duration
component in terms of prompt emission associated with short GRBs.

emission is collimated into a cone and the received flux depends on the cone
aperture angle. Fortunately we can derive the aperture angle through an
achromatic steepening of the lightcurve of the afterglow, and thus we can
measure the ""true"" energetics of the prompt emission. Ghirlanda et al. (2004)
found that this collimation-corrected energy correlates tightly with
thefrequency at which most of the radiation of the prompt is emitted. Through
this correlation we can infer the burst energy accurately enough for a
cosmological use. Using the best known 15 GRBs we find very encouraging results
that emphasize the cosmological GRB role. Probing the universe with high
accuracy up to high redshifts, GRBs establish a new insight on the cosmic
expanding acceleration history and accomplish the role of ""missing link""
between the Cosmic Microwave Background and type Ia supernovae, motivating the
most optimistic hopes for what can be obtained from the bursts detected by

  afterglow modeling","  We report on BeppoSAX simultaneous X- and gamma-ray observations of the
bright GRB 990123. We present the broad-band spectrum of the prompt emission,
including optical, X- and gamma-rays, confirming the suggestion that the
emission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have different physical
origins. In the framework of the standard fireball model, we discuss the X-ray
afterglow observed by the NFIs and its hard X-ray emission up to 60 keV several
hours after the burst, detected for about 20 ks by the PDS. Considering the
2-10 keV and optical light curves, the 0.1-60 keV spectrum during the 20 ks in
which the PDS signal was present and the 8.46 GHz upper limits, we find that
the multi-wavelength observations cannot be readily accommodated by basic
afterglow models. While the temporal and spectral behavior of the optical
afterglow is possibly explained by a synchrotron cooling frequency between the
optical and the X-ray energy band during the NFIs observations, in X-rays this
assumption only accounts for the slope of the 2-10 keV light curve, but not for
the flatness of the 0.1-60 keV spectrum. Including the contribution of Inverse
Compton (IC) scattering, we solve the problem of the flat X-ray spectrum and
justify the hard X-ray emission; we suggest that the lack of a significant
detection of 15-60 keV emission in the following 75 ks and last 70 ks spectra,
should be related to poorer statistics rather than to an important suppression
of IC contribution. However, considering also the radio band data, we find the
8.46 GHz upper limits violated. On the other hand, leaving unchanged the
emission mechanism requires modifying the hydrodynamics by invoking an ambient
medium whose density rises rapidly with radius and by having the shock losing
energy. Thus we are left with an open puzzle which requires further inspection.

Explorer Proportional Counter Array between 2003 September and 2004 April, that
we show to originate from the transient magnetar candidate XTE J1810-197. The
burst morphologies consist of a short spike or multiple spikes lasting ~1 s
each followed by extended tails of emission where the pulsed flux from XTE
J1810-197 is significantly higher. The burst spikes are likely correlated with
the pulse maxima, having a chance probability of a random phase distribution of
0.4%. The burst spectra are best fit to a blackbody with temperatures 4-8 keV,
considerably harder than the persistent X-ray emission. During the X-ray tails
following these bursts, the temperature rapidly cools as the flux declines,
maintaining a constant emitting radius after the initial burst peak. During the
brightest X-ray tail, we detect a narrow emission line at 12.6 keV with an
equivalent width of 1.4 keV and a probability of chance occurrence less than 4
x 10^-6. The temporal and spectral characteristics of these bursts closely
resemble the bursts seen from 1E 1048.1-5937 and a subset of the bursts
detected from 1E 2259+586, thus establishing XTE J1810-197 as a magnetar
candidate. The bursts detected from these three objects are sufficiently
similar to one another, yet significantly different from those seen from soft
gamma repeaters, that they likely represent a new class of bursts from magnetar
candidates exclusive (thus far) to the anomalous X-ray pulsar-like sources.

Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP) 1E 1048.1-5937 using the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE). We find a simultaneous increase of ~3.5 times the quiescent
value in the 2-10 keV pulsed flux of 1E 1048.1-5937 during the tail of the
burst which identifies the AXP as the burst's origin. The burst was overall
very similar to the two others reported from the direction of this source in
2001. The unambiguous identification of 1E 1048.1-5937 as the burster here
confirms it was the origin of the 2001 bursts as well. The epoch of the burst
peak was very close to the arrival time of 1E 1048.1-5937's pulse peak. The
burst exhibited significant spectral evolution with the trend going from hard
to soft. During the 11 days following the burst, the AXP was observed further
with RXTE, XMM-Newton and Chandra. Pre- and post-burst observations revealed no
change in the total flux or spectrum of the quiescent emission. Comparing all
three bursts detected thus far from this source we find that this event was the
most fluent (>3.3x10^-8 erg/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), had the highest peak
flux (59+/-9x10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), and the longest duration
(>699 s). The long duration of the burst differentiates it from Soft Gamma
Repeater (SGR) bursts which have typical durations of ~0.1 s. Bursts that occur
preferentially at pulse maximum, have fast-rises and long X-tails containing
the majority of the total burst energy have been seen uniquely from AXPs. The
marked differences between AXP and SGRs bursts may provide new clues to help
understand the physical differences between these objects.

additional evidence indicating that this burst is an isolated one, but we
cannot completely rule out additional undetected bursts that may have occured
with the same ~77 min. periodicity observed in 2002 or with a different
periodicity. Assuming the peak emission was detected, the decay time of the

window into the earliest epoch of cosmic star formation. We construct separate
star formation histories at high redshifts for normal (Pop I and II) stars, and
for predominantly massive (Pop III) stars. Based on these separate histories,
we predict the GRB redshift distribution to be observed by the {\it Swift}
mission. Regardless of whether Pop III progenitors are able to trigger GRBs, we
find that a fraction 10% of all bursts detected by {\it Swift} will originate
at z > 5. This baseline contribution is due to Pop I/II star formation which
must have extended out to high redshifts in rare massive galaxies that were
enriched by heavy elements earlier than the typical galaxies. In addition, we
consider the possible contribution of Pop III progenitors to the observable GRB
rate. Pop III stars are viable progenitors for long-duration GRBs which are
triggered by the collapsar mechanism, as long as they can lose their outer
envelope through mass transfer to a companion star in a close binary. We find
that the likelihood of Pop III binaries to satisfy the conditions required by
the collapsar mechanism could be enhanced significantly relative to Pop I/II
binaries. If Pop III binaries are common, {\it Swift} will be first observatory
to probe Pop III star formation at redshifts z > 7.

detected by the Swift satellite is observed to have a phase of very slow flux
decline with time ($F_\nu \propto t^{-\alpha}$ with $0.2 \lesssim \alpha
\lesssim 0.8$) for $10^{2.5} s \lesssim t \lesssim 10^4$ s, while the
subsequent decline is the usual $1 \lesssim \alpha_3 \lesssim 1.5$ behavior,
that was seen in the pre-Swift era. We show that this behavior is a natural
consequence of a small spread in the Lorentz factor of the ejecta, by a factor
of $\sim 2-4$, where the slower ejecta gradually catch-up with the shocked
external medium, thus increasing the energy of forward shock and delaying its
deceleration. The end of the ``shallow'' flux decay stage marks the beginning
of the Blandford-McKee self similar external shock evolution. This suggests
that most of the energy in the relativistic outflow is in material with a
Lorentz factor of $\sim 30-50$.

hr later by the Swift X-ray Telescope, making it one of the very few X-ray
non-detections of a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglow at early times. The
gamma-ray light-curve shows at least three peaks, the first two of which (~T_0
- 0.8 and T_0 + 0.2 s, where T_0 is the trigger time) were short, each lasting
0.5 s. This was followed by later emission 10-20 s post-burst. The upper limit
on the unabsorbed X-ray flux was 1.7 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (integrating 46 ks
of data taken between 11 and 18 September), indicating that the decay must have
been rapid. All but one of the long bursts detected by Swift were above this
limit at ~4.6 hr, whereas the afterglows of short bursts became undetectable
more rapidly. Deep observations with Gemini also revealed no optical afterglow
12 hr after the burst, down to r=24.0 (5-sigma limit). We speculate that GRB
050911 may have been formed through a compact object (black hole-neutron star)
merger, with the later outbursts due to a longer disc lifetime linked to a
large mass ratio between the merging objects. Alternatively, the burst may have

periodic tails by generating Lomb periodograms of the emission following short
bursts detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE). Out of
358 short bursts examined, one has a significant tail periodicity (T = 13.8 s,
P = 4 x 10^-5). The most probable host galaxy for this burst is ""The Fireworks
Galaxy"" NGC 6946 (d = 5.9 Mpc). At this distance, the energy of the spike, (2.7
+/- 0.3) x 10^44 ergs, is akin to those of the galactic magnetar giant flares,
as are its duration (~ 0.4 s) and temperature (250 +/- 60 keV). For the tail
emission, however, our estimated temperature of 60 +/- 5 keV is harder and the
energy release of (4.3 +/- 0.8) x 10^45 ergs is larger than those of the
galactic magnetar flares. Regardless of the host, such a large ratio of
tail-to-spike energy would imply that magnetar flare tails might be detectable
out to further distances than previously thought.

showing a flare in its X-ray light curve. During this flare, which peaks at
t_peak ~210s after the BAT trigger, a flux variation of (delta F)/F~6 in a very
short time (delta t)/t_peak<<1 was observed. Its measured fluence in the 0.2-10
keV band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the prompt
fluence. We present indications of spectral variations during the flare. We
argue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies that
the central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power with
respect to the prompt emission. The X-ray light curve flattens to a very
shallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supports
continued central engine activity at late times. This burst is classified as an
X-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 keV
band, E_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significant
flux above ~50 keV and a peak energy E_p<15 keV. XRF 050406 is one of the first
examples of a well-studied X-ray light curve of an XRF. We show that the main
afterglow characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of normal GRBs. In
particular, X-ray flares superimposed on a power-law light curve have now been
seen in both XRFs and GRBs. This indicates that a similar mechanism may be at
work for both kinds of events.

2006. This is a nearby long GRB, with a very low peak energy, and is therefore
classified as an X-ray Flash (XRF). XRF 060218 is clearly associated with a
supernova -- dubbed SN 2006aj. We present early spectra for SN 2006aj as well
as optical lightcurves reaching out to 50 days past explosion. Our optical
lightcurves define the rise times, the lightcurve shapes and the absolute
magnitudes in the U, V and R bands, and we compare these data with data for
other relevant supernovae. SN 2006aj evolved quite fast, somewhat similarly to
SN 2002ap, but not as fast as SN 1994I. Our spectra show the evolution of the
supernova over the peak, when the U-band portion of the spectrum rapidly fades
due to extensive line blanketing. We compare to similar spectra of very
energetic Type Ic supernovae. Our first spectra are earlier than spectra for
any other GRB-SN. The spectrum taken 12 days after burst in the rest frame is
similar to somewhat later spectra of both SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh, implying a
rapid early evolution. This is consistent with the fast lightcurve.
  From the narrow emission lines from the host galaxy we derive a redshift of
z=0.0331+-0.0007. This makes XRF 060218 the second closest gamma-ray burst
detected. The flux of these emission lines indicate a high-excitation state,
and a modest metallicity and star formation rate of the host galaxy.

find X-ray bursts. IBIS/ISGRI detector lightcurves total count rate in the

detected with a high statistical significance (only one event over the entire
period of observations could be detected by a chance with a probability of
20%). Apart from the events associated with cosmic gamma-ray bursts (detected
in the field of view or passed through the IBIS shield), solar flares, and
activity of the soft gamma repeater SGR1806-20, we were able to localize 105
bursts and, with one exception, to identify them with previously known
persistent or transient X-ray sources (96 were identified with known X-ray
bursters). In one case, the burst source was a new burster in a low state. We
named it IGR J17364-2711. Basic parameters of the localized bursts and their
identifications are presented in the catalog of bursts. Curiously enough, 61
bursts were detected from one X-ray burster - GX 354-0. The statistical
distributions of bursts in duration, maximum flux, and recurrence time have

would have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-based
optical imaging with the 2-m robotic Faulkes Telesscope (FTN). Our
multiwavelength analysis reveals an X-ray light curve typical of many Swift
long GRBs (3-segments plus flare). Its optical afterglow, however, was already
fainter than the detection limit of the UVOT within 100s of the burst. Optical
imaging in BVRi' filters with the FTN began 2.75 minutes after the burst and
resulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a UKIRT
K-band identification at ~45 mins. R and i'-band light curves are consistent
with a single power law decay in flux, F(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a
2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 <0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,
with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. Deep VLT R-band imaging at ~12 days
reveals a faint, extended object (R ~23.5 mag) at the location of the
afterglow. Although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of the
a_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. This implies
that the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observed
in the X-rays. We derive a maximum photometric redshift z<3.2 for GRB 060108
and a best-fitting optical-to-X-ray SED at 1000 s after the burst consistent
with a power law with index beta_OX = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.
The unambiguous detection at B-band and the derived photometric redshift rule
out a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of GRB 060108.
Instead, the hard opt/X-ray spectral index confirms it as one of the
optically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains the
UVOT non-detection (abridged).

observed properties of the single burst detected differ significantly from
those measured previously, suggesting that GCRT J1745-3009 was detected in a
new physical state. The 2004 flux density was ~0.05 Jy, ~10x weaker than the
single 2003 burst and ~30x weaker than the five bursts detected in 2002. We
derive a very steep spectral index, alpha = -13.5 +/- 3.0, across the bandpass,
a new result previously not detectable due to limitations in the analysis of
the 2002 and 2003 observations. Also, the burst was detected for only ~2 min.,
in contrast to the 10 min. duration observed in the earlier bursts. Due to
sparse sampling, only the single burst was detected in 2004, as in the 2003
epoch, and we cannot rule out additional undetected bursts that may have
occurred with the same ~77 min. periodicity observed in 2002 or with a
different periodicity. Considering our total time on source throughout both our
archival and active monitoring campaigns, we estimate the source exhibits
detectable bursting activity ~7% of the time.

We also present neutrino effective areas which allow the calculation of limits
for any neutrino production model. The first analysis looked for a statistical
excess of events within a sliding window of 1 or 100 seconds (for short and
long burst classes, respectively) during the years 2001-2003. The resulting
upper limit on the diffuse flux normalization times E^2 for the Waxman-Bahcall

theoretical prediction). For this search 90% of the neutrinos would fall in the
energy range 50 TeV to 7 PeV. The second analysis looked for neutrino-induced
cascades in coincidence with 73 bursts detected by BATSE in the year 2000. The
resulting upper limit on the diffuse flux normalization times E^2, also at 1
PeV, is 1.5 x 10^-6 GeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 (a factor of 110 above the theoretical
prediction) for the same energy range. The neutrino-induced cascade channel is
complementary to the up-going muon channel. We comment on its advantages for
searches of neutrinos from GRBs and its future use with IceCube.

The problem of identifying the jet breaks is discussed in the complex and
multibreak/flaring X-ray light curves observed by Swift. We use the optical
data as the most reliable source for the identification of the jet break, since
the X-ray flux may be produced by a mechanism different from the external
shocks between the fireball and the circumburst medium, which are responsible
for the optical afterglow. We show that the presence of an underlying SN event
in XRF 050416A requires a break to occur in the afterglow optical light curve
at around the expected jet break time. The possible presence of a jet break in
the optical light curve of GRB 050401 is also discussed. We point out that, for
measuring the jet break, it is mandatory that the optical light curve extends
after the epoch where the jet break is expected. The interpretation of the
early optical breaks in GRB 050922C and GRB 060206 as jet breaks is
controversial because they might instead correspond to the flat-to-steep decay
transition common in the early X-ray light curves. All the 16 bursts coming
from Swift are consistent with the E_p-E_gamma and E_p-E_iso-t_jet correlation.
No outlier is found to date. Moreover, the small dispersion of these
correlations, confirmed also by the Swift bursts, strengthens the case of using
GRBs as standard candles.

  Gamma-Ray Bursts","  Recent rapid localizations of short, hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by the
Swift and HETE satellites have led to the observation of the first afterglows
and the measurement of the first redshifts from this type of burst. Detection
of >100 GeV counterparts would place powerful constraints on GRB mechanisms.
Seventeen short duration (< 5 s) GRBs detected by satellites occurred within
the field of view of the Milagro gamma-ray observatory between 2000 January and
2006 December. We have searched the Milagro data for >100 GeV counterparts to
these GRBs and find no significant emission correlated with these bursts. Due
to the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by the extragalactic background
light (EBL), detections are only expected for redshifts less than ~0.5. While
most long duration GRBs occur at redshifts higher than 0.5, the opposite is
thought to be true of short GRBs. Lack of a detected VHE signal thus allows
setting meaningful fluence limits. One GRB in the sample (050509b) has a likely
association with a galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, while another (051103) has
been tentatively linked to the nearby galaxy M81. Fluence limits are corrected
for EBL absorption, either using the known measured redshift, or computing the
corresponding absorption for a redshift of 0.1 and 0.5, as well as for the case
of z=0.

by the BAT instrument between and including GRBs 041220 and 070509, including
77 events with measured redshifts. Incorporating prior knowledge into the
spectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectral
peak energy $E_{\rm pk,obs}$ and the isotropic equivalent energy $E_{\rm iso}$
(1--$10^4$ keV) for all events. This complete and rather extensive catalog,
analyzed with a unified methodology, allows us to address the persistence and
origin of high-energy correlations suggested in pre-Swift observations. We find
that the $E_{\rm pk,obs}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation is present in the Swift
sample; however, the best-fit powerlaw relation is inconsistent with the
best-fit pre-Swift relation at >5 sigma significance. Moreover, it has a factor
>~ 2 larger intrinsic scatter, after accounting for large errors on $E_{\rm
pk,obs}$. A large fraction of the Swift events are hard and subluminous
relative to (and inconsistent with) the pre-Swift relation, in agreement with
indications from BATSE GRBs without redshift. Moreover, we determine an
experimental threshold for the BAT detector and show how the $E_{\rm
pk,obs}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation arises artificially due to partial
correlation with the threshold. We show that pre-Swift correlations found by
Amati et al.(2002), Yonetoku et al. (2004), Firmani et al.(2006) (and
independently by others) are likely unrelated to the physical properties of
GRBs and are likely useless for tests of cosmology. Also, an explanation of
these correlations in terms of a detector threshold provides a natural and

  sources","  While waiting for new gamma-ray burst detections, the Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT) on board Swift covers each day ~50% of the sky in the hard X-ray band
(``Survey data''). The large field of view (FOV), high sensitivity and good
angular resolution make BAT a potentially powerful all-sky hard X-ray monitor,
provided that mask--related systematics can be properly accounted for. We have
developed and tested a complete procedure entirely based on public Swift/BAT
software tools to analyse BAT Survey data, aimed at assessing the flux and
spectral variability of bright sources in the 15-150 keV energy range. Detailed
tests of the capabilities of our procedure were performed focusing, in
particular, on the reliability of spectral measurements over the entire BAT
FOV. First, we analyzed a large set of Crab observations, spread over ~7
months. Next, we studied the case of GRO J1655-40, a strongly variable source,
which experienced a 9-month long outburst, beginning on February 2005. Such an
outburst was systematically monitored with the well-calibrated PCA and HEXTE
instruments on board the RXTE mission. Thanks to the good BAT temporal coverage
of the source, we have been able to cross-check BAT light-curves with
simultaneous HEXTE ones. The Crab tests have shown that our procedure recovers
both the flux and the source spectral shape over the whole FOV of the BAT
instrument. Moreover, by cross-checking GRO J1655-40 light-curves obtained by
BAT and HEXTE, we found the spectral and flux evolution of the outburst to be
in very good agreement. Using our procedure, BAT reproduces HEXTE fluxes within
a 10-15% uncertainty with a 3sigma sensitivity of ~20 mCrab for an on-axis
source, thus establishing its capability to monitor the evolution of relatively
bright hard X-rays sources.

will be localized to better than 40 arcsec at threshold, with a burst position
as good as a few arcsec for strong bursts. EXIST's combination of three

quite general types of burst signal waveforms. The best upper-limit strain
amplitudes we obtain are h_{rss}=O(10^{-20})Hz^{-1/2} around 200-1500 Hz. These
upper-limits allow us to evaluate the level up to which Virgo, when reaching
nominal sensitivity, will be able to constrain the gravitational wave output

role of a prototype, crucial in defining a methodology for gamma-ray burst

redshift and spectral parameters, detected up to September 2007. We confirm the
existence of a strong rest frame correlation Ep ~ Eiso^0.54+-0.01. Contrary to
previous studies, no sign of evolution with redshift of the Ep-Eiso correlation
(either its slope and normalisation) is found. The 76 bursts define a strong
Ep,obs-Fluence correlation in the observer frame (Ep,obs ~ F^0.32+-0.05) with
redshifts evenly distributed along this correlation. We study possible
instrumental selection effects in the observer frame Ep,obs-Fluence plane. In
particular, we concentrate on the minimum peak flux necessary to trigger a
given GRB detector (trigger threshold) and the minimum fluence a burst must
have to determine the value of Ep,obs (spectral analysis threshold). We find
that the latter dominates in the Ep,obs-Fluence plane over the former. Our
analysis shows, however, that these instrumental selection effects do not
dominate for bursts detected before the launch of the Swift satellite, while
the spectral analysis threshold is the dominant truncation effect of the Swift
GRB sample (27 out of 76 events). This suggests that the Ep,obs-Fluence
correlation defined by the pre--Swift sample could be affected by other, still
not understood, selection effects. Besides we caution about the conclusions on
the existence of the Ep,obs-Fluence correlation based on our Swift sample
alone.

optical/near-infrared (NIR) with various telescopes starting from about 2min
after the high-energy event. Swift-XRT observations started only later at about
0.4d. The light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phase
with a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context of
the standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decay
interrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. The rebrightening was
visible in both the optical/NIR and X-rays and can be interpreted as an episode
of discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. A
steepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. The entire
evolution of the optical/NIR afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.
This could be one of the few identified GRB afterglows with an achromatic break
in the X-ray through the optical/NIR bands. Polarimetry was also obtained at
about 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with the
steepening. This provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for the

GRB (T_90 < 2s) in five years of observation since October 2002. This work
presents the properties of the prompt emission of GRB 070707, which is the
first short hard GRB observed by INTEGRAL. The spectral and temporal properties
of GRB 070707 were determined using the two sensitive coded-mask gamma-ray
instruments on board INTEGRAL, IBIS and SPI. The T_90 duration was 0.8s, and
the spectrum of the prompt emission was obtained by joint deconvolution of IBIS
and SPI data to yield a best fit power-law with photon index alpha = -1.19
+0.14 -0.13, which is consistent with the characteristics of short-hard
gamma-ray bursts. The peak flux over 1 second was 1.79 photons/cm^2/s and the
fluence over the same interval was 2.07 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 in the energy range
20-200keV. The spectral lag measured between 25-50keV and 100-300keV is 20 +/-
5ms, consistent with the small or negligible lags measured for short bursts.
The spectral and temporal properties of GRB 070707 are comparable to those of
the short hard bursts detected by other gamma-ray satellites, including BATSE
and Swift. We estimate a lower limit on the Lorentz factor Gamma >~ 25 for GRB
070707, assuming the typical redshift for short GRBs of z=0.35. This limit is
consistent with previous estimates for short GRBs and is smaller than the lower
limits of Gamma >~ 100 calculated for long GRBs. If GRB 070707 is a member of
the recently postulated class of short GRBs at z ~ 1, the lower limit on Gamma
increases to Gamma >~ 35.

the quiescent time between the end of the precursor and the start of the main

was about 2E+41 erg/s. Our data show that the outburst was accompanied by a
fast flux enhancement and by a hardening of the spectrum with respect to the
persistent emission.

  Gamma Ray Bursts","  Correlation studies of prompt and afterglow emissions from gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) between different spectral bands has been difficult to do in the past
because few bursts had comprehensive and intercomparable afterglow
measurements. In this paper we present a large and uniform data set for
correlation analysis based on bursts detected by the Swift mission. For the
first time, short and long bursts can be analyzed and compared. It is found for
both classes that the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are linearly
correlated, but with a large spread about the correlation line; stronger bursts
tend to have brighter afterglows, and bursts with brighter X-ray afterglow tend
to have brighter optical afterglow. Short bursts are, on average, weaker in
both prompt and afterglow emissions. No short bursts are seen with extremely
low optical to X-ray ratio as occurs for ""dark"" long bursts. Although
statistics are still poor for short bursts, there is no evidence yet for a
subgroup of short bursts with high extinction as there is for long bursts. Long
bursts are detected in the dark category at the same fraction as for pre-Swift
bursts. Interesting cases are discovered of long bursts that are detected in
the optical, and yet have low enough optical to X-ray ratio to be classified as
dark. For the prompt emission, short and long bursts have different average
tracks on flux vs fluence plots. In Swift, GRB detections tend to be fluence
limited for short bursts and flux limited for long events.

High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE2), the INTErnational Gamma-Ray
Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), and the Interplanetary Network (IPN). The
catalog covers GRBs occurring during the period from 2005 Jan 17 to 2007 Jun 16
and includes ~86% of the bursts detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT). The catalog provides detailed burst positional, temporal, and
photometric information extracted from each of the UVOT images. Positions for
bursts detected at the 3-sigma-level are provided with a nominal accuracy,
relative to the USNO-B1 catalog, of ~0.25 arcseconds. Photometry for each burst
is given in three UV bands, three optical bands, and a 'white' or open filter.
Upper limits for magnitudes are reported for sources detected below 3-sigma.
General properties of the burst sample and light curves, including the
filter-dependent temporal slopes, are also provided. The majority of the UVOT
light curves, for bursts detected at the 3-sigma-level, can be fit by a single
power-law, with a median temporal slope (alpha) of 0.96, beginning several
hundred seconds after the burst trigger and ending at ~1x10^5 s. The median
UVOT v-band (~5500 Angstroms) magnitude at 2000 s for a sample of ""well""
detected bursts is 18.02. The UVOT flux interpolated to 2000 s after the burst,
shows relatively strong correlations with both the prompt Swift BAT fluence,
and the Swift X-ray flux at 11 hours after the trigger.

gamma-ray bursts detected so far, GRB 080913. Based on these observations, we
consider whether it could be classified as a short-duration GRB and discuss the
implications for the progenitor nature and energy extraction mechanisms.
  Methods: Multiwavelength X-ray, near IR and millimetre observations were made
between 20.7 hours and 16.8 days after the event.
  Results: Whereas a very faint afterglow was seen at the 3.5m CAHA telescope
in the nIR, the X-ray afterglow was clearly detected in both Swift and
XMM-Newton observations. An upper limit is reported in the mm range. We have
modeled the data assuming a collimated $\theta_0$ $\gtrsim$ 3$^\circ$ blast
wave with an energy injection at 0.5 days carrying $5\sim 10^{52}$ erg or
approximately 12 times the initial energy of the blast wave. We find that GRB
080913 shares many of the gamma-ray diagnostics with the more recent burst GRB
090423 for being classified as short had they ocurred at low redshift. If the
progenitor were a compact binary merger, it is likely composed by a NS and BH.
The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism is the preferred one to extract energy from
the central, maximally-rotating BH. Both the magnetic field close to the event
horizon (B) and the BH mass ($M_{bh}$) are restricted within a relatively
narrow range, such that $(B / 3\times 10^{16} \rm{G}) (M_{bh} / 7 M_\odot) \sim
1$. Similar constraints on the central BH hold for collapsar-like progenitor
systems if the BZ-mechanism works for the system at hand.

amplitude of 0.29% rms, a factor of ten less than the largest amplitude seen
early in the outburst.
  X-ray burst activity continued through 2008, with bursts typically featuring

Alert System, 50% of the IBIS GRBs have detected afterglows, while 5% have
redshift measurements. A spectral analysis of the 43 bursts in the INTEGRAL
public archive has been carried out using the most recent software and
calibration, deriving an updated, homogeneous and accurate catalogue with the
spectral features of the sample. When possible also a time-resolved spectral
analysis has been carried out. The GRBs in the sample have 20-200 keV fluences
in the range 5 x 1E-8 --2.5 x 1E-4 erg cm-2, and peak fluxes in the range 0.11

power law, resulting in Ep values in the range 35--190 keV. Altough these
results are comparable with those obtained with BAT onboard Swift, there is a
marginal evidence that ISGRI detects dimmer bursts than Swift/BAT. Using the
revised spectral parameters and an updated sky exposure map that takes into

we find that ultra-relativistic beads produce a scale-invariant stochastic

In some experiments, one makes several counts of the number of events, using
different instruments, different event detection algorithms, or observations
over multiple time intervals. We demonstrate how to generalize the classical
frequentist upper limit calculation to the case where multiple counts of events
are made over one or more time intervals using several (not necessarily

possible outcomes in the space of counts correspond to applying different
levels of significance to the various measurements. We propose an ordering that
is matched to the sensitivity of the different measurement procedures and show
that in typical cases it gives stronger upper limits than other choices. As an
example, we show how this method can be applied to searches for
gravitational-wave bursts, where multiple burst-detection algorithms analyse
the same data set, and demonstrate how a single combined upper limit can be set

Ray Bursts (GRBs) over an energy range potentially spanning six orders of
magnitude. In the hard X-ray band the SuperAGILE imager provides localization
of about one GRB/month plus the detection of 1-2 GRBs per month out of its
field of view. The Mini-Calorimeter detects about one GRB/week in the 350keV -
100MeV energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.
In fact, the on-board MCAL trigger logic, implemented for the first time on
time windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for very
short bursts detection. The Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID), sensitive in the
30MeV - 30GeV range, firmly detected three GRBs (GRB080514B, GRB090401B and
GRB090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. Moreover,
all GRBs localized by other spacecrafts inside the GRID field of view are
currently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided. In
this paper we review the status of the observation of GRBs with AGILE, with
particular emphasis on high energy and short time scales detections.

episodes, called ""precursors"", whose nature is still a puzzle: they could
either have the same origin as the main emission episode or they could be due
to another mechanism. We investigate if precursors have some spectral
distinctive feature with respect to the main GRB episodes. Methods: To this aim
we compare the spectral evolution of the precursor with that of the main GRB
event. We also study if and how the spectral parameters, and in particular the
peak of the vFv spectrum of time resolved spectra, correlates with the flux.
This allows us to test if the spectra of the precursor and of the main event
belong to the same correlation (if any). We searched GRBs with precursor
activity in the complete sample of 2704 bursts detected by BATSE finding that
12% of GRBs have one or more precursors. Among these we considered the bursts
with time resolved spectral analysis performed by Kaneko et al. 2006, selecting
those having at least two time resolved spectra for the precursor. Results: We
find that precursors and main events have very similar spectral properties. The
spectral evolution within precursors has similar trends as the spectral
evolution observed in the subsequent peaks. Also the typical spectral
parameters of the precursors are similar to those of the main GRB events.
Moreover, in several cases we find that within the precursors the peak energy
of the spectrum is correlated with the flux similarly to what happens in the
main GRB event. This strongly favors models in which the precursor is due to
the same fireball physics of the main emission episodes.

  Suzaku-WAM","  One of the most prominent, yet controversial associations derived from the
ensemble of prompt-phase observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is the
apparent correlation in the source frame between the peak energy Epeak) of the
nu-F(nu) spectrum and the isotropic radiated energy, Eiso. Since most gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) have Epeak above the energy range (15-150 keV) of the Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) on Swift, determining accurate Epeak values for large numbers
of Swift bursts has been difficult. However, by combining data from Swift/BAT
and the Suzaku Wide-band All-Sky Monitor (WAM), which covers the energy range
from 50-5000 keV, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one can
accurately fit Epeak and Eiso and test the relationship between them for the
Swift sample. Between the launch of Suzaku in July 2005 and the end of April
2009, there were 48 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which triggered both Swift/BAT and
WAM and an additional 48 bursts which triggered Swift and were detected by WAM,
but did not trigger. A BAT-WAM team has cross-calibrated the two instruments
using GRBs, and we are now able to perform joint fits on these bursts to
determine their spectral parameters. For those bursts with spectroscopic
redshifts, we can also calculate the isotropic energy. Here we present the
results of joint Swift/BAT-Suzaku/WAM spectral fits for 91 of the bursts
detected by the two instruments. We show that the distribution of spectral fit
parameters is consistent with distributions from earlier missions and confirm
that Swift bursts are consistent with earlier reported relationships between
Epeak and isotropic energy. We show through time-resolved spectroscopy that
individual burst pulses are also consistent with this relationship.

detected by the Fermi satellite. Their fluxes and fluences are large enough to
allow a time dependent study of their spectral characteristics in the 8 keV-1
MeV energy range. We find that the peak energy Ep of their EL(E) spectrum
correlates with the luminosity in a remarkable tight way within individual
bursts. This time resolved Ep-Liso correlation is very similar for all the
considered bursts, and has a slope and normalisation similar to the analogous
Ep-Liso correlation defined by the time integrated spectra of different bursts
detected by several different satellites. For a few of the considered GRBs, we
could also study the behaviour of the Ep-Liso correlation during the rising and
decaying phases of individual pulses within each burst, finding no differences.
Our results indicate the presence of a similar physical mechanism, operating
for the duration of different GRBs, linking tightly the burst luminosity with
the peak energy of the spectrum emitted at different times. Such a physical
mechanism is the same during the rise and decay phase of individual pulses
composing a GRB. These results, while calling for a robust physical
interpretation, strongly indicate that the Ep-Liso spectral energy correlation
found considering the time integrated spectra of different bursts is real, and
not the result of instrumental selection effects.

energy injection in external shock. Here we present a detailed numerical study
on the energy injection process of magnetic dipole radiation from a strongly
magnetized millisecond pulsar and model the multi-band afterglow observations.
It is found that this model can successfully explain the long plateaus in the
observed X-ray and optical afterglow light curves. The sharp break following
the plateaus should be due to the rapid decline of the emission power of the
central pulsar. At an even late time (~5*10^6s), an obvious jet break appears,
which implies a relatively large half opening angle of theta~0.3 for the GRB
ejecta. Due to the energy injection, the Lorentz factor of the outflow is still
larger than two 10^7s post the GRB trigger, making the X-ray afterglow of this

Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi/Large Area Telescope (LAT) until
October 2009. The GeV emission has three main properties: (i) its duration is
often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma
Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the
Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is
consistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;
(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power
law with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux
can be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the
prompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies. The decay slope is what
expected if the fireball emission is produced in the radiative regime, i.e. all
dissipated energy is radiated away. We also argue that the detectability in the
GeV energy range depends on the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the bursts, being
strongly favoured in the case of large Gamma. This implies that the fraction of
bursts detected at high energies corresponds to the fraction of bursts having
the largest Gamma. The radiative interpretation can help to explain why the
observed X-ray and optical afterglow energetics are much smaller than the
energetics emitted during the prompt phase, despite the fact that the collision
with the external medium should be more efficient than internal shocks in
producing the radiation we see.

census of intrinsic GRB energetics, hardnesses, durations, and redshifts. The
GRB world model we derive reproduces well the observables from both Swift and
pre-Swift satellites. Comparing to the cosmic star formation rate, we estimate
that only about 0.1% of massive stars explode as bright GRBs. There is strong
evidence for evolution in the Swift population at intermediate and high-z, and
we can rule out (at the 5-sigma level) that this is due to evolution in the
luminosity function of GRBs. Instead, the Swift sample suggests a modest
propensity for low-metallicity, evidenced by an increase in the rate density
with redshift. Treating the multivariate data and selection effects rigorously,
we find a real, intrinsic correlation between E_iso and E_pk (and possibly also
duration); however, the correlation {\it is not} a narrow log-log relation and
its observed appearance is strongly detector-dependent. We also estimate the
high-z rate (3--9% of GRBs at z beyond 5) and discuss the extent of a large
missing population of low-E_pk XRFs as well as a potentially large missing
population of short-duration GRBs that will be probed by EXIST.

bursts of soft gamma repeaters (SGR) and is at least two orders of magnitude
larger than the luminosity of the previously reported bursts from AXPs.
Similarly to the SGR bursts, the brightest bursts of 1E 1547.0-5408 consist of
a short spike of ~100 ms duration with a hard spectrum, followed by a softer
extended tail of 1-10 s duration, which occasionally exhibits pulsations with

$z=2.609$). Its host galaxy properties and some $\gamma$-ray related
correlations are analogous to those seen in long duration GRBs, which are
believed to be of a massive-star origin (so-called Type II GRBs). We present
the results of its early optical observations with the 0.8-m TNT telescope at
Xinglong observatory, and the 1-m LOAO telescope at Mt. Lemmon Optical
Astronomy Observatory in Arizona. Our well-sampled optical afterglow lightcurve
covers from $\sim 90$ seconds to $\sim 10^4$ seconds post the GRB trigger. It
shows two shallow decay episodes that are likely due to energy injection, which
end at $\sim 230$ seconds and $\sim 7100$ seconds, respectively. The decay
slopes post the injection phases are consistent with each other ($\alpha\simeq
1.22$). The X-ray afterglow lightcurve appears to trace the optical, although
the second energy injection phase was missed due to visibility constraints
introduced by the {\em Swift} orbit. The X-ray spectral index is $\beta_X\sim
1.0$ without temporal evolution. Its decay slope is consistent with the
prediction of the forward shock model. Both X-ray and optical emission is
consistent with being in the same spectral regime above the cooling frequency
($\nu_c$). The fact that $\nu_c$ is below the optical band from the very early
epoch of the observation provides a constraint on the burst environment, which
is similar to that seen in classical long duration GRBs. We therefore suggest
that death of a massive star is the possible progenitor of this short burst.

of bursts, is now an established property of roughly the 10% of all bursts,
thanks to the Fermi/LAT observations. GRB 090510, a short burst, is
particularly interesting because the good timing allows to derive a severe
limit to theories of quantum gravity. With the dozen bursts detected in the
0.1-30 GeV band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) the
duration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by
the Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistent
with F(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightest
bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power law with a typical
slope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the GBM emission exceeds 500 keV (rest
frame). These properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the GeV
flux. We propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly following
the start of the prompt phase. The steep decay slope suggests that the fireball
emits in the radiative regime, i.e. all dissipated energy is radiated away. The
large peak energy of the GBM flux suggests that electron-positron pairs might
play a crucial role. The rapid onset, but with some delay, of the GeV flux with
respect to the GBM one suggests that the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of these
bursts is of the order of 1000. Therefore the relatively small fraction of
bursts detected at high energies might correspond to the fraction of bursts
having the largest Gamma. If the emission occurs in the radiative regime we can
start to understand why the observed X-ray and optical afterglow energetics are
much smaller than the energetics emitted during the prompt phase.

detected by the GBM at ~1 MeV, and the implications of the non detection of the
vast majority, ~95%, of the LGRBs at higher energy, ~1 GeV, by the LAT
detector. We find a LF that is consistent with those determined by BATSE and
Swift. The non detections by LAT set upper limits on the ratio R of the prompt
fluence at ~1 GeV to that at ~1 MeV. The upper limits are more stringent for
brighter bursts, with R<{0.1,0.3,1} for {5,30,60}% of the bursts. This implies
that for most bursts the prompt ~1 GeV emission may be comparable to the ~1 MeV
emission, but can not dominate it. The value of R is not universal, with a
spread of (at least) an order of magnitude around R~10^(-1). For several bright
bursts with reliable determination of the photon spectral index at ~1 MeV, the
LAT non detection implies an upper limit to the ~100 MeV flux which is <0.1 of
the flux obtained by extrapolating the ~1 MeV flux to high energy. For the
widely accepted models, in which the ~1 MeV power-law photon spectrum reflects
the power-law energy distribution of fast cooling electrons, this suggests that
either the electron energy distribution does not follow a power-law over a wide
energy range, or that the high energy photons are absorbed. Requiring an order
unity pair production optical depth at ~100 MeV sets an upper limit for the
Lorentz factor, Gamma<=10^(2.5).

formed through phase transitions in the early Universe. The central black holes
in clusters can serve as the seeds of supermassive black holes in galactic
nuclei. The expected burst detection rate by the LISA gravitational wave
detector is estimated.

$10^{21}$\,eV) and the energy budget ($10^{44}\, \rm{erg\, yr^{-1}\,
Mpc^{-3}}$) to accommodate the spectrum of the highest energy cosmic rays; on
the other hand, there is no observational evidence that they accelerate
hadrons. The Fermi GST recently observed two bursts that exhibit a power-law
high-energy extension of the typical (Band) photon spectrum that extends to
$\sim 30$ GeV. On the basis of fireball phenomenology we argue that they, along
with GRB941017 observed by EGRET in 1994, show indirect evidence for
considerable baryon loading. Since the detection of neutrinos is the only
unambiguous way to establish that GRBs accelerate protons, we use two methods
to estimate the neutrino flux produced when they interact with fireball photons
to produce charged pions and neutrinos. While the number of events expected
from the Fermi bursts detected to date is small, we conclude that an event like
GRB941017 will be detected by the IceCube neutrino telescope if gamma-ray
bursts are indeed the sources of the observed cosmic rays.

the Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) up to February 2010 with those of
bursts detected by the CGRO/BATSE instrument. Out of 227 Fermi GRBs, 166 have a
measured peak energy E_peak_obs of their \nuF(\nu) spectrum: of these 146 and
20 belong the long and short class, respectively. Fermi long bursts follow the
correlations defined by BATSE bursts between their E_peak_obs vs fluence and
peak flux: as already shown for the latter ones, these correlations and their
slopes do not originate from instrumental selection effects. Fermi/GBM bursts
extend such correlations toward lower fluence/peak energy values with respect
to BATSE ones whereas no GBM long burst with E_peak_obs exceeding a few MeV is
found, despite the possibility of detecting them. Again as for BATSE, $\sim$ 5%
of long and almost all short GRBs detected by Fermi/GBM are outliers of the
E_peak-isotropic equivalent energy (""Amati"") correlation while no outlier
(neither long nor short) of the E_peak-isotropic equivalent luminosity
(""Yonetoku"") correlation is found. Fermi long bursts have similar typical
values of E_peak_obs but a harder low energy spectral index with respect to all
BATSE events, exacerbating the inconsistency with the limiting slopes of the
simplest synchrotron emission models. Although the short GRBs detected by Fermi
are still only a few, we confirm that their E_peak_obs is greater and the low
energy spectrum is harder than those of long ones. We discuss the robustness of
these results with respect to observational biases induced by the differences
between the GBM and BATSE instruments.

transient X-ray burster XTE J1810-189. The observations were performed on April
3--6, 2008, soon after the discovery of the source and near the peak of its
outburst. That time the source had a flux of about 50 mCrab and exhibited a
hard Comptonized X-ray spectrum extending well above 100 keV. Being
approximated by a power law with an exponetial cut-off in the broad 3--100 keV
energy band it gave the average photon index $\Gamma\simeq 1.6$ and
$kT_{cutoff}\simeq 67$ keV. We found only slight indications for changes in the
index during the observation ($\Gamma$ first steady decreased from $\sim 2.0$
to $\sim1.3$ and then increased back to $\sim 2.0$). However the $N_{\rmn H}$
value measured by absorption in the low energy part of the spectrum changed
drastically and very irregularly (from $\sim 4\times 10^{22}$ till $\sim
100\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$). There were 10 type I X-ray bursts detected from
the source during these TOO observations. Assuming that the Eddington
luminosity was reached during the burst with the highest peak flux we get an
upper estimate for a distance to the source $D=6.4\pm0.6$ kpc. From the X-ray
burst parameters we conclude that this LMXB harboures an evolved star.

binary neutron star mergings which can be accompanied by short gamma-ray
bursts. Detection of such bursts appear to be advantageous in the low-frequency
radio band due to a time delay of ten to several hundred seconds required for
radio signal to propagate in the ionized intergalactic medium. This delay makes
it possible to use short gamma-ray burst alerts to promptly monitor specific
regions on the sky by low-frequency radio facilities, especially by LOFAR. To
estimate the strength of the radio signal, we assume a power-law dependence of
the radio luminosity on the total energy release in a magnetically dominated
outflow, as found in millisecond pulsars. Based on the planned LOFAR
sensitivity at 120 MHz, we estimate that the LOFAR detection rate of such radio
transients could be about several events per month from redshifts up to
$z\sim1.3$ in the most optimistic scenario. The LOFAR ability to detect such
events would crucially depend on exact efficiency of low-frequency radio
emission mechanism.

090510 made with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope
(LAT) on board the Fermi observatory. GRB 090510 is the first burst detected by
the LAT that shows strong evidence for a deviation from a Band spectral fitting
function during the prompt emission phase. The time-integrated spectrum is fit
by the sum of a Band function with $\Epeak = 3.9\pm 0.3$\,MeV, which is the
highest yet measured, and a hard power-law component with photon index
$-1.62\pm 0.03$ that dominates the emission below $\approx$\,20\,keV and above
$\approx$\,100\,MeV. The onset of the high-energy spectral component appears to
be delayed by $\sim$\,0.1\,s with respect to the onset of a component well fit
with a single Band function. A faint GBM pulse and a LAT photon are detected
0.5\,s before the main pulse. During the prompt phase, the LAT detected a
photon with energy $30.5^{+5.8}_{-2.6}$ GeV, the highest ever measured from a
short GRB. Observation of this photon sets a minimum bulk outflow Lorentz
factor, $\Gamma\ga$\,1200, using simple $\gamma\gamma$ opacity arguments for
this GRB at redshift $z = 0.903$ and a variability time scale on the order of
tens of ms for the $\approx$\,100\,keV--few MeV flux. Stricter high confidence
estimates imply $\Gamma \ga 1000$ and still require that the outflows powering
short GRBs are at least as highly relativistic as those of long duration GRBs.
Implications of the temporal behavior and power-law shape of the additional
component on synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), external-shock
synchrotron, and hadronic models are considered.

  families","  Gravitational Wave (GW) burst detection algorithms typically rely on the
hypothesis that the burst signal is ""locally stationary"", that is it changes
slowly with frequency. Under this assumption, the signal can be decomposed into
a small number of wavelets with constant frequency. This justifies the use of a
family of sine-Gaussian templates in the Omega pipeline, one of the algorithms
used in LIGO-Virgo burst searches. However there are plausible scenarios where
the burst frequency evolves rapidly, such as in the merger phase of a binary
black hole and/or neutron star coalescence. In those cases, the local
stationarity of sine-Gaussians induces performance losses, due to the mismatch
between the template and the actual signal. We propose an extension of the
Omega pipeline based on chirplet-like templates. Chirplets incorporate an
additional parameter, the chirp rate, to control the frequency variation. In
this paper, we show that the Omega pipeline can easily be extended to include a
chirplet template bank. We illustrate the method on a simulated data set, with
a family of phenomenological binary black-hole coalescence waveforms embedded
into Gaussian LIGO/Virgo-like noise. Chirplet-like templates result in an
enhancement of the measured signal-to-noise ratio.

Fermi/GBM. It is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission had
already been detected when the GRB itself was still radiating in the gamma-ray
band. For nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray data
provide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient source
from about 1 eV to 150 keV. In particular, we show that the SED during the main
prompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. We constructed the
optical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based on
Swift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIa (Australia), and GROND (La Silla) data and compared it
to the X-ray light curve retrieved from the Swift/XRT repository. We show that
its bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forward
shock.Furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolution
of the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early X-ray light
curve can be explained by large-angle emission (LAE). We find that a
nonstandard LAE model is required to explain the observations. Finally, we
report on the results of our search for the GRB host galaxy, for which only a
deep upper limit can be provided.

thermonuclear burning may be ejected during radius-expansion bursts, giving
rise to photoionisation edges in the X-ray spectra. We report a search for such
features in Chandra spectra observed from the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34.
We analysed the spectra from four radius-expansion bursts detected in 2006
July, and two in 2002 March, but found no evidence for discrete features. We
estimate upper limits for the equivalent widths of edges of a few hundred eV,
which for the moderate temperatures observed during the bursts, are comparable
with the predictions. During the 2006 July observation 4U 1728-34 exhibited
weak, unusually frequent bursts (separated by <2 hr in some cases), with
profiles and alpha-values characteristic of hydrogen-poor fuel. Recurrence
times as short as those measured are insufficient to exhaust the accreted
hydrogen at solar composition, suggesting that the source accretes hydrogen
deficient fuel, for example from an evolved donor. The detection for the first
time of a 10.77 min periodic signal in the persistent intensity, perhaps
arising from orbital modulation, supports this explanation, and suggests that
this system is an ultracompact binary similar to 4U 1820-30.

first discovery of a rare, impulsive event of unknown extragalactic origin
(Lorimer et al. 2007). The extragalactic interpretation was based on the
swept-frequency nature of the event, which followed the dispersive delay
expected from an extragalactic pulse. We report here on the detection of 16
pulses, the bulk of which exhibit a frequency sweep with a shape and magnitude
resembling the Lorimer Burst. These new events were detected in a sidelobe of
the Parkes Telescope and are of clearly terrestrial origin, with properties
unlike any known sources of terrestrial broad-band radio emission. The new
detections cast doubt on the extragalactic interpretation of the original
burst, and call for further sophistication in radio-pulse survey techniques to
identify the origin of the anomalous terrestrial signals and definitively
distinguish future extragalactic pulse detections from local signals. The
ambiguous origin of these seemingly dispersed, swept-frequency signals suggest
that radio-pulse searches using multiple detectors will be the only experiments
able to provide definitive information about the origin of new swept-frequency

  link","  The neutron star transient and 11 Hz X-ray pulsar IGR J17480-2446, recently
discovered in the globular cluster Terzan 5, showed unprecedented bursting
activity during its 2010 October-November outburst. We analyzed all X-ray
bursts detected with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and find strong evidence
that they all have a thermonuclear origin, despite the fact that many do not
show the canonical spectral softening along the decay imprinted on type I X-ray
bursts by the cooling of the neutron star photosphere. We show that the
persistent-to-burst power ratio is fully consistent with the
accretion-to-thermonuclear efficiency ratio along the whole outburst, as is
typical for type I X-ray bursts. The burst energy, peak luminosity and
daily-averaged spectral profiles all evolve smoothly throughout the outburst,
in parallel with the persistent (non-burst) luminosity. We also find that the
peak burst to persistent luminosity ratio determines whether or not cooling is
present in the bursts from IGR J17480-2446, and argue that the apparent lack of
cooling is due to the ""non-cooling"" bursts having both a lower peak temperature
and a higher non-burst (persistent) emission. We conclude that the detection of
cooling along the decay is a sufficient, but not a necessary condition to
identify an X-ray burst as thermonuclear. Finally, we compare these findings
with X-ray bursts from other rapidly accreting neutron stars.

centered on gamma ray bursts detected between 2004 and 2008 and observed with
total exposures ranging from 10 ks to over 1 Ms. This defines the Swift
Serendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields, which is quite broad compared to
existing surveys (~33 square degrees) and medium depth, with a faintest flux
limit of 7.2e-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5 to 2 keV energy range. The survey
has a high degree of uniformity thanks to the stable point spread function and
small vignetting correction factors of the XRT, moreover is completely random
on the sky as GRBs explode in totally unrelated parts of the sky. In this paper
we present the sample and the X-ray number counts of the high Galactic-latitude
sample, estimated with high statistics over a wide flux range (i.e., 7.2e-16 to
~5e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band and 3.4e-15 to ~6e-13 erg cm^-2
s^-1 in the 2-10 keV band). We detect 9387 point-like sources, while 7071
point-like sources are found at high Galactic-latitudes (i.e. >=20 deg). The
large number of detected sources resulting from the combination of large area
and deep flux limits make this survey a new important tool for investigating
the evolution of AGN. In particular, the large area permits finding rare
high-luminosity objects like QSO2, which are poorly sampled by other surveys,
adding precious information for the luminosity function bright end. The high
Galactic-latitude logN-logS relation is well determined over all the flux
coverage, and it is nicely consistent with previous results at 1 sigma
confidence level. By the hard X-ray color analysis, we find that the Swift
Serendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields samples relatively unobscured and
mildly obscured AGN, with a fraction of obscured sources of ~37% (~15%) in the
2-10 (0.3-3 keV) band.

long-duration GRBs (L-GRBs), short-duration GRBs (S-GRBs), and short-duration

the prompt emission properties. The fraction of L-GRBs, S-GRBs and S-GRBs with

are similar to those of the HETE-2 GRB samples. By time-resolved spectral
analysis, we find that only 10% of the BAT observed photon indices are outside
the allowed region of the synchrotron shock model.

  absorbers","  GRB 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the most
extensively observed so far. Nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open in
the literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the GRB environment. In
particular, GRB 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic halo
environment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and the
non-detection of an underlying host galaxy. In this work we collect all
publicly available data and address these issues by modelling the NIR-to-X-ray
spectral energy distribution (SED) and studying the high signal-to-noise
VLT/FORS afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of GRB
absorbers. The SED reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the UV, low
equivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a LMC- or
SMC-type extinction curve. From the weak MgII absorption at z=1.5477 in the
spectrum, we derived logN(MgII)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ionic
column density of several metals. These suggest that the GRB absorber is most
likely an LLS with a 0.03Z\odot<Z<1.3Z\odot metallicity. The comparison with
other GRB absorbers places GRB070125 at the low end of the absorption line
equivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features and
spectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.
Moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surrounding
the GRB, combined with a low N(HI) along a short segment of the line of sight
within the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in GRB070125.
Finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faint
GRB host galaxy, well within the GRB host brightness distribution. Thus, the
possibility that GRB070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,
massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems more
likely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

  generation","  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory forms part of the
international effort to detect and study gravitational waves of astrophysical
origin. One of the major obstacles for this project with the first generation
detectors was the effect of seismic noise on instrument sensitivity -
environmental disturbances causing motion of the interferometer optics,
coupling as noise in the gravitational wave data output. Typically transient
noise events have been identified by finding coincidence between noise in an
auxiliary data signal (with negligible sensitivity to gravitational waves) and
noise in the gravitational wave data, but attempts to include seismometer
readings in this scheme have proven ineffective. We present a new method of
generating a list of times of high seismic noise by tuning a gravitational wave
burst detection pipeline to the low frequency signature of these events. This
method has proven very effective at removing transients of seismic origin from
the gravitational wave (GW) data with only a small loss of analysable time. We
also present an outline for extending this method to other noise sources.

will be difficult to use a burst signal to extract information on fossil

presence of an extended emission of gamma-rays, often delayed with respect to

  based on the likelihood's block gradient","  The proposed smooth blockwise iterative thresholding estimator (SBITE) is a
model selection technique defined as a fixed point reached by iterating a
likelihood gradient-based thresholding function. The smooth James-Stein
thresholding function has two regularization parameters $\lambda$ and $\nu$,
and a smoothness parameter $s$. It enjoys smoothness like ridge regression and
selects variables like lasso. Focusing on Gaussian regression, we show that
SBITE is uniquely defined, and that its Stein unbiased risk estimate is a
smooth function of $\lambda$ and $\nu$, for better selection of the two
regularization parameters. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to investigate
the predictive and oracle properties of this smooth version of adaptive lasso.
  The motivation is a gravitational wave burst detection problem from several
concomitant time series. A nonparametric wavelet-based estimator is developed
to combine information from all captors by block-thresholding multiresolution
coefficients. We study how the smoothness parameter $s$ tempers the erraticity
of the risk estimate, and derive a universal threshold, an information
criterion and an oracle inequality in this canonical setting.

bursts detected with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope in the 15-150 keV band
from January 2005 to August 2011. For the first time we derived the average PDS
in the source rest frame of 97 GRBs with known redshift. For 49 of them an
average PDS was also obtained in a common source-frame energy band to account
for the dependence of time profiles on energy. Previous results obtained on
BATSE GRBs with unknown redshift showed that the average spectrum in the
25-2000 keV band could be modelled with a power-law with a 5/3 index over
nearly two decades of frequency with a break at ~1 Hz. Depending on the
normalisation and on the subset of GRBs considered, our results show analogous
to steeper slopes (between 1.7 and 2.0) of the power-law. However, no clear
evidence for the break at ~1 Hz was found, although the softer energy band of
BAT compared with BATSE might account for that. We instead find a break at
lower frequency corresponding to a typical source rest frame characteristic
time of a few seconds. We furthermore find no significant differences between
observer and source rest frames. Notably, no distinctive PDS features are found
for GRBs with different intrinsic properties of the prompt emission either.
Finally, the average PDS of GRBs at higher redshifts shows possibly shallower
power-law indices than that of low-z GRBs. It is not clear whether this is due
to an evolution with z of the average PDS.

  Burst Monitor","  A Band function has become the standard spectral function used to describe
the prompt emission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, deviations
from this function have previously been observed in GRBs detected by BATSE and
in individual GRBs from the \textit{Fermi} era. We present a systematic and
rigorous search for spectral deviations from a Band function at low energies in
a sample of the first two years of high fluence, long bursts detected by the
\textit{Fermi} Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The sample contains 45 bursts
with a fluence greater than 2$\times10^{-5}$ erg / cm$^{2}$ (10 - 1000 keV). An
extrapolated fit method is used to search for low-energy spectral anomalies,
whereby a Band function is fit above a variable low-energy threshold and then
the best fit function is extrapolated to lower energy data. Deviations are
quantified by examining residuals derived from the extrapolated function and
the data and their significance is determined via comprehensive simulations
which account for the instrument response. This method was employed for both
time-integrated burst spectra and time-resolved bins defined by a signal to
noise ratio of 25 $\sigma$ and 50 $\sigma$. Significant deviations are evident
in 3 bursts (GRB\,081215A, GRB\,090424 and GRB\,090902B) in the time-integrated
sample ($\sim$ 7%) and 5 bursts (GRB\,090323, GRB\,090424, GRB\,090820,
GRB\,090902B and GRB\,090926A) in the time-resolved sample ($\sim$ 11%).} The
advantage of the systematic, blind search analysis is that it can demonstrate
the requirement for an additional spectral component without any prior
knowledge of the nature of that extra component. Deviations are found in a
large fraction of high fluence GRBs; fainter GRBs may not have sufficient
statistics for deviations to be found using this method.

short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): 100625A, 101219A and 110112A. We find
that GRB 100625A occurred in a z=0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of
4.6e9 M_Sun and a stellar population age of 0.7 Gyr, and GRB 101219A originated
in a star-forming galaxy at z=0.718 with a stellar mass of 1.4e9 M_Sun, a star
formation rate of 16 M_Sun yr^-1, and a stellar population age of 50 Myr. We
also report the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 110112A, which lacks
a coincident host galaxy to i>26 mag and we cannot conclusively identify any
field galaxy as a possible host. The bursts have inferred circumburst densities
of ~1e-4-1 cm^-3, and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of
1e50-1e51 erg. These events highlight the diversity of galaxies that host short
GRBs. To quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 Swift short GRBs with
robust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected by
Swift to May 2012) and classify them as follows: late-type (50%), early-type
(15%), inconclusive (20%), and host-less (lacking a coincident host galaxy to
limits of >26 mag; 15%). To find likely ranges for the true late- and
early-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to the late- or
early-type category using probabilistic arguments, and consider the scenario
that all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set an
upper bound on the early-type fraction. The most likely ranges for the late-
and early-type fractions are ~60-80% and ~20-40%, respectively. We find no
clear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type, and no change to the
fractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants from
the long GRB/collapsar population. Our reported demographics are consistent
with a short GRB rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.

spectral component is accompanied by a dominating non-thermal one. Only four
bursts detected by Batse have a pure blackbody spectrum throughout their
duration. We present the new case of GRB 100507 detected by the Gamma Burst
Monitor on board the Fermi satellite. GRB 100507 has a blackbody spectrum for
the entire duration (~30 s) of the prompt emission. The blackbody temperature
varies between 25 and 40 keV. The flux varies between 1e-7 and 4e-7 erg/cm2 s.
There is no clear evidence of a correlation between the temperature and the
blackbody flux. If the thermal emission in GRB 100507 is due to the fireballs
becoming transparent, we can estimate the radius R_T and bulk Lorentz factor
Gamma_T corresponding to this transition and the radius R_0 where the fireballs
are created. We compare these parameters with those derived for the other four
bursts with a pure blackbody spectrum. In all but one burst, for fiducial
assumptions on the radiative efficiency and distance of the sources,
R_0~1e9-1e10 cm, i.e. much larger than the gravitational radius of a few solar
mass black hole. Possible solutions of this apparent inconsistency are
tentatively discussed considering the dependence of R_0 on the unknown
parameters. Alternatively, such a large R_0 could be where the fireball, still
opaque, converts most of its kinetic energy into internal energy (due to the
impact with some material left over by the progenitor star) and starts to
re-accelerate.

afterglows of GRB 081007 and GRB 090424, two bursts detected by Swift. One of
them, GRB 081007, also shows a spectroscopically confirmed supernova, SN
2008hw, which resembles SN 1998bw in its absorption features, while the maximum
luminosity is only about half as large as that of SN 1998bw. Bright optical
flashes have been detected in both events, which allows us to derive solid
constraints on the circumburst-matter density profile. This is particularly
interesting in the case of GRB 081007, whose afterglow is found to be
propagating into a constant-density medium, yielding yet another example of a
GRB clearly associated with a massive star progenitor which did not sculpt the
surroundings with its stellar wind. There is no supernova component detected in
the afterglow of GRB 090424, likely due to the brightness of the host galaxy,
comparable to the Milky Way. We show that the afterglow data are consistent
with the presence of both forward- and reverse-shock emission powered by
relativistic outflows expanding into the interstellar medium. The absence of
optical peaks due to the forward shock strongly suggests that the reverse shock
regions should be mildly magnetized. The initial Lorentz factor of outflow of
GRB 081007 is estimated to be \Gamma ~ 200, while for GRB 090424 a lower limit
of \Gamma > 170 is derived. We also discuss the prompt emission of GRB 081007,
which consists of just a single pulse. We argue that neither the external
forward-shock model nor the shock-breakout model can account for the prompt
emission data and suggest that the single-pulse-like prompt emission may be due
to magnetic energy dissipation of a Poynting-flux dominated outflow or to a
dissipative photosphere.

extra-galactic. FRB 110220 has a scattering tail of $\sim 5.6\pm 0.1 \ms$. If
the electron density fluctuations arise from a turbulent cascade, the

the central region of its host galaxy. Pulse durations of order $\ms$ constrain
the sizes of FRB sources implying high brightness temperatures that indicates
coherent emission. Electric fields near FRBs at cosmological distances would be
so strong that they could accelerate free electrons from rest to relativistic

peak flux, duration, and bandwidth, of the individual burst elements were
satisfactorily detected by the highly resolved spectral data of AMATEAS with
the burst detection algorithm that is improved in this study. The peak flux of
the type-I bursts followed a power-law distribution with a spectral index of
2.9-3.3, whereas their duration and bandwidth were distributed more
exponentially. There were almost no correlations between the peak flux,
duration, and bandwidth. That means there were no similarity shapes in the
burst spectral structures. We defined the growth rate of a burst as the ratio
between its peak flux and duration. There was a strong correlation between the
growth rate and peak flux. These results suggest that the free energy of type-I
bursts that is originally generated by non-thermal electrons is modulated in
the subsequent stages of the generation of non-thermal electrons, such as
plasma wave generation, radio wave emissions, and propagation. The variation of
the time scale of the growth rate is significantly larger than that of the
coronal environments. These results can be explained by the situation that the

as the boundary of open and closed field lines, and the superposition of entire
emitted bursts was observed by the spectrometer.

In this work we model the optical and X-ray emission in the reverse and forward

Consequently the outflow powering the highly-polarized reverse shock optical

Considering the plausible magnetic energy dissipation in both the acceleration

dominated by Fe II, O I, and Ca II absorption lines at ejecta velocities of
20,000 km/s that change slowly over time. Other spectral absorption lines are
consistent with contributions from photospheric He I, and hydrogen may also be

toroidal ejecta geometry is an alternative explanation. SN 2012ap joins SN
2009bb as another exceptional supernova that shows evidence for a central
engine (e.g., black-hole accretion or magnetar) capable of launching a
non-negligible portion of ejecta to relativistic velocities without a
coincident gamma-ray burst detection. Defining attributes of their progenitor
systems may be related to notable properties including above-average
environmental metallicities of Z > Zsolar, moderate to high levels of
host-galaxy extinction (E(B-V) > 0.4 mag), detection of high-velocity helium at
early epochs, and a high relative flux ratio of [Ca II]/[O I] > 1 at nebular
epochs. These events support the notion that jet activity at various energy
scales may be present in a wide range of supernovae.

frame energy band for a sample of 232 Swift/BAT detected GRBs. Binning the data

redshift that can be modelled with a power-law for all three measures.
Comparing redshift defined subsets of rest-frame duration reveals that the
observed distributions of these durations are broadly consistent with
cosmological time dilation. To ascertain if this is an instrumental effect, a
similar analysis of Fermi/GBM data for the 57 bursts detected by both
instruments is conducted, but inconclusive due to small number statistics. We
then investigate under-populated regions of the duration redshift parameter
space. We propose that the lack of low-redshift, long duration GRBs is a
physical effect due to the sample being volume limited at such redshifts.
However, we also find that the high-redshift, short duration region of
parameter space suffers from censorship as any Swift GRB sample is
fundamentally defined by trigger criteria determined in the observer frame
energy band of Swift/BAT. As a result, we find that the significance of any
evidence for cosmological time dilation in our sample of duration measures
typically reduces to $<2\sigma$.

  in the Konus-Wind short burst sample","  The knowledge of the rate of soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) giant flares is
important for understanding the giant flare mechanism and the SGR energy budget
in the framework of the magnetar model. We estimate the upper limit to the rate
using the results of an extensive search for extragalactic soft gamma-repeater
giant flares (GFs) among 140 short gamma-ray bursts detected between 1994 and
2010 by Konus-Wind using InterPlanetary Network (IPN) localizations and
temporal parameters. We show that Konus-Wind and the IPN are capable of
detecting GFs with energies of 2.3x10^46 erg (which is the energy of the GF
from SGR 1806-20 assuming a distance of 15 kpc) at distances of up to about 30
Mpc and GFs with energies of <10^45 erg (which is the energy of the GF from SGR
0526-66) at distances of up to about 6 Mpc. Using a sample of 1896 nearby
galaxies we found that only two bursts, GRB 051103 and GRB 070201, have a low
chance coincidence probability between an IPN localization and a nearby galaxy.
We found the upper limit to the fraction of GFs among short GRBs with fluence
above ~5x10^-7 erg cm^-2 to be <8% (95% confidence level). Assuming that the
number of active SGRs in nearby galaxies is proportional to their core-collapse
supernova rate, we derived the one-sided 95% upper limit to the rate of GFs
with energy output similar to the GF from SGR 1806-20 to be (0.6--1.2)x10^-4
Q_46^-1.5 yr^-1 per SGR, where Q_46 is the GF energy output in 10^46 erg.

oriented towards the observer. However, for each GRB with a typical theta_jet,
there should be ~2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewhere
in space. These off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to the
deceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparable
to the viewing angle. Orphan Afterglows (OA) should outnumber the current
population of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not been
conclusively observed so far at any frequency. We compute the expected flux of
the population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and X-ray bands through
a population synthesis code of GRBs and the standard afterglow emission model.
We estimate the detection rate of OA by on-going and forthcoming surveys. The
average duration of OA as transients above a given limiting flux is derived and
described with analytical expressions: in general OA should appear as daily
transients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radio
band. We find that ~ 2 OA yr^-1 could already be detected by Gaia and up to 20
OA yr^-1 could be observed by the ZTF survey. A larger number of 50 OA yr^-1
should be detected by LSST in the optical band. For the X-ray band, ~ 26 OA
yr^-1 could be detected by the eROSITA. For the large population of OA
detectable by LSST, the X-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for the
brightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm and
radio band could be the key to disentangle their GRB nature from other
extragalactic transients of comparable flux density.

the range of 3.5--8.7 kpc for the first time. During its outburst, XTE
J1810-189 did not enter into the high/soft state, and both the soft and hard
colours decreased with decreasing flux. The fractional rms remained at high
values ($\sim 30$ per cent). The RXTE/PCA spectra for 3-25 keV can be described
by an absorbed power-law component with an additional Gaussian component, and
the derived photon index $\Gamma$ increased from $1.84\pm0.01$ to $2.25\pm0.04$

material producing the emission moves at relativistic speed, then the
variability of the resulting light curve depends on the viewing angle. This is
due to the fact that the pulse evolution time scale is Doppler contracted,
while the pulse separation is not. For off-axis viewing angles $\theta_{\rm
view} \gtrsim \theta_{\rm jet} + \Gamma^{-1}$, the pulse broadening
significantly smears out the light curve variability. This is largely
independent of geometry and emission processes. To explore a specific case, we
set up a simple model of a single pulse under the assumption that the pulse
rise and decay are dominated by the shell curvature effect. We show that such a
pulse observed off-axis is (i) broader, (ii) softer and (iii) displays a
different hardness-intensity correlation with respect to the same pulse seen
on-axis. For each of these effects, we provide an intuitive physical
explanation. We then show how a synthetic light curve made by a superposition
of pulses changes with increasing viewing angle. We find that a highly variable
light curve, (as seen on-axis) becomes smooth and apparently single-pulsed
(when seen off-axis) because of pulse overlap. To test the relevance of this
fact, we estimate the fraction of off-axis gamma-ray bursts detectable by
\textit{Swift} as a function of redshift, finding that a sizable fraction
(between 10\% and 80\%) of nearby ($z<0.1$) bursts are observed with
$\theta_{\rm view} \gtrsim \theta_{\rm jet} + \Gamma^{-1}$. Based on these
results, we argue that low luminosity gamma-ray bursts are consistent with
being ordinary bursts seen off-axis.

the FRB rate at 800 MHz based on the only burst detected at frequencies below

Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been the confirmation that several emission
components can be present in the energy spectrum. Here we reanalyse the
spectrum of GRB 080825C using data from the Fermi LAT and GBM instruments.
Although fairly weak, it is the first gamma-ray burst detected by the
Fermi-LAT. We improve on the original analysis by using the LAT Low Energy
(LLE) events covering the 30-00 MeV band. We find evidence of an additional
component above the main emission peak (modelled using a Band function) with a
significance of 3.5 $\sigma$ in 2 out of the 4 time bins. The component is well
fitted by a Planck function, but shows unusual behaviour: the peak energy
increases in the prompt emission phase, reaching energies of several MeV. This
is the first time such a trend has been seen, and implies that the origin of
this component is different from those previously detected. We suggest that the
two spectral components likely arise in different regions of the outflow, and
that strong constraints can be achieved by assuming one of them originates from
the photosphere. The most promising model appears to be that the high-energy

Telescope about 0.4 seconds after the gravitational waves observed by the LIGO
and VIRGO Collaborations originated from the same black hole merger event, we
perform a model-independent analysis of different quantum gravity scenarios
based on (modified) dispersion relations (typical of quantum gravity models)
for the graviton and the photon. We find that only scenarios where at least one
of the two particles is luminal (the other being sub- or super-luminal) are
allowed, while scenarios where none of the two particles is luminal are ruled
out. Moreover, the physical request of having acceptable values for the quantum
gravity scale imposes stringent bounds on the difference between the velocities
of electromagnetic and gravitational waves, much more stringent than any
previously known bound.

spacecraft on 2015 April 12. The IPN localization of the source is consistent
with the position of the recently discovered soft gamma-repeater SGR 1935+2154.
From the Konus-Wind (KW) observation, we derive temporal and spectral
parameters of the emission, and the burst energetics. The rather long duration
of the burst ($\sim$1.7 s) and the large measured energy fluence
($\sim2.5\times10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) put it in the class of rare
""intermediate"" SGR flares, and this is the first one observed from SGR
1935+2154. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the KW light curve
yields no statistically significant signal. Of four spectral models tested,
optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung and a single blackbody (BB) function can
be rejected on statistical grounds; two more complex models, a cutoff power law
(CPL) and a sum of two BB functions (2BB), fit the burst spectra well and
neither of them may be ruled out by the KW observation. The CPL and 2BB model
parameters we report for this bright flare are typical of SGRs; they are also
consistent with those obtained from observations of much weaker and shorter SGR
1935+2154 bursts with other instruments. From the distribution of double
blackbody spectral fit parameters we estimate the SGR 1935+2154 distance to be
$<$10.0 kpc, in agreement with that of the Galactic supernova remnant G57.2+0.8
at 9.1 kpc.

rare instance with comprehensive in situ and remote sensing observa- tions of a
CME combining white-light, radio, and plasma measurements from four different
vantage points. For the first time, we have successfully applied a radio
direction-finding technique to an interplanetary type II burst detected by two
identical widely separated radio receivers. The derived locations of the type
II and type III bursts are in general agreement with the white light CME recon-

and are most likely associated with the CME-driven shock. Our work demon-
strates the complementarity between radio triangulation and 3D reconstruction
techniques for space weather applications.

  150906B","  We present the results of the search for gravitational waves (GWs) associated
with $\gamma$-ray bursts detected during the first observing run of the
Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We find no
evidence of a GW signal for any of the 41 $\gamma$-ray bursts for which LIGO
data are available with sufficient duration. For all $\gamma$-ray bursts, we
place lower bounds on the distance to the source using the optimistic
assumption that GWs with an energy of $10^{-2}M_\odot c^2$ were emitted within
the $16$-$500\,$Hz band, and we find a median 90% confidence limit of 71$\,$Mpc
at 150$\,$Hz. For the subset of 19 short/hard $\gamma$-ray bursts, we place
lower bounds on distance with a median 90% confidence limit of 90$\,$Mpc for
binary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and 150 and 139$\,$Mpc for neutron
star-black hole coalescences with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum
and in a generic configuration, respectively. These are the highest distance
limits ever achieved by GW searches. We also discuss in detail the results of
the search for GWs associated with GRB 150906B, an event that was localized by
the InterPlanetary Network near the local galaxy NGC 3313, which is at a
luminosity distance of 54$\,$Mpc ($z=0.0124$). Assuming the $\gamma$-ray
emission is beamed with a jet half-opening angle $\leq 30^{\circ}$, we exclude
a BNS and a neutron star-black hole in NGC 3313 as the progenitor of this event
with confidence $>99$%. Further, we exclude such progenitors up to a distance
of 102$\,$Mpc and 170$\,$Mpc, respectively.

  from preterm infants","  The study of electroencephalographic (EEG) bursts in preterm infants provides
valuable information about maturation or prognostication after perinatal
asphyxia. Over the last two decades, a number of works proposed algorithms to
automatically detect EEG bursts in preterm infants, but they were designed for
populations under 35 weeks of post menstrual age (PMA). However, as the brain
activity evolves rapidly during postnatal life, these solutions might be
under-performing with increasing PMA. In this work we focused on preterm
infants reaching term ages (PMA $\geq$ 36 weeks) using multi-feature
classification on a single EEG channel. Five EEG burst detectors relying on
different machine learning approaches were compared: Logistic regression (LR),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector
machines (SVM) and thresholding (Th). Classifiers were trained by visually
labeled EEG recordings from 14 very preterm infants (born after 28 weeks of
gestation) with 36 - 41 weeks PMA. The most performing classifiers reached
about 95\% accuracy (kNN, SVM and LR) whereas Th obtained 84\%. Compared to
human-automatic agreements, LR provided the highest scores (Cohen's kappa =
0.71) and the best computational efficiency using only three EEG features.
Applying this classifier in a test database of 21 infants $\geq$ 36 weeks PMA,
we show that long EEG bursts and short inter-bust periods are characteristic of
infants with the highest PMA and weights. In view of these results, LR-based
burst detection could be a suitable tool to study maturation in monitoring or
portable devices using a single EEG channel.

merge in the Hubble time to produce powerful gravitational wave bursts detected

the evolution from field low-metallicity massive binaries, the dynamical
formation in globular clusters and primordial black holes. Low effective black

Population synthesis calculations of the expected spin and chirp mass

ongoing and future gravitational wave observations.

despite dozens of hours of telescope time spent on follow-up observations, no
other FRBs have been observed to repeat. Yet, it has been speculated that the
repeater is the prototype of FRBs, and that other FRBs should show similar
repeating patterns. Using the published data, we compare the repeater with
other FRBs in the observed time interval ($\Delta t$) - flux ratio ($S_i /
S_{i+1}$) plane. We find that whereas other FRBs occupy the upper (large $S_i /
S_{i+1}$) and right (large $\Delta t$) regions of the plane due to the
non-detections of other bursts, some of the repeater bursts fall into the
lower-left region of the plot (short interval and small flux ratio) excluded by
the non-detection data of other FRBs. The trend also exists even if one only
selects those bursts detectable by the Parkes radio telescope. If other FRBs
were similar to the repeater, our simulations suggest that the probability that
none of them have been detected to repeat with the current searches would be
$\sim (10^{-4}-10^{-3})$. We suggest that the repeater is not representative of
the entire FRB population and that there is strong evidence of more than one
population of FRBs.

millisecond X-ray pulsars, showing direct evidence of switches between states
of rotation powered radio pulsations and accretion powered X-ray pulsations,
dubbed transitional pulsars. IGR~J18245--2452 is the only transitional pulsar
so far to have shown a full accretion episode, reaching an X-ray luminosity of
$\sim10^{37}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ permitting its discovery with INTEGRAL in 2013. In
this paper, we report on a detailed analysis of the data collected with the
IBIS/ISGRI and the two JEM-X monitors on-board INTEGRAL at the time of the 2013
outburst. We make use of some complementary data obtained with the instruments
on-board XMM-Newton and Swift in order to perform the averaged broad-band
spectral analysis of the source in the energy range 0.4 -- 250~keV. We have
found that this spectrum is the hardest among the accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsars. We improved the ephemeris, now valid across its full outburst, and
report the detection of pulsed emission up to $\sim60$ keV in both the ISGRI
($10.9 \sigma$) and Fermi/GBM ($5.9 \sigma$) bandpass. The alignment of the
ISGRI and Fermi GBM 20 -- 60 keV pulse profiles are consistent at a $\sim25\

with the soft \gr-ray ones, and derived the pulsed fractions of the fundamental

$150\ \mu$s, as a function of energy. We report on a thermonuclear X-ray burst
detected with \Integ, and using the properties of the previously type-I X-ray

campaign, we made the first simultaneous detection of an FRB burst by multiple
telescopes: the VLA at 3 GHz and the Arecibo Observatory at 1.4 GHz. Of the
nine bursts detected by the Very Large Array at 3 GHz, four had simultaneous
observing coverage at other observatories. We use multi-observatory constraints
and modeling of bursts seen only at 3 GHz to confirm earlier results showing
that burst spectra are not well modeled by a power law. We find that burst
spectra are characterized by a ~500 MHz envelope and apparent radio energy as
high as $10^{40}$ erg. We measure significant changes in the apparent
dispersion between bursts that can be attributed to frequency-dependent
profiles or some other intrinsic burst structure that adds a systematic error
to the estimate of DM by up to 1%. We use FRB 121102 as a prototype of the FRB
class to estimate a volumetric birth rate of FRB sources $R_{FRB} \approx
5x10^{-5}/N_r$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, where $N_r$ is the number of bursts per

different source distributions of total masses ${M_\mathrm{tot}}$ and effective

progenitors (from zero-metal Population III stars up to solar metal abundance),
different initial rotations of the binary components, stellar wind mass loss

efficiencies. The stellar rotation is treated in two-zone (core-envelope)
approximation using the effective core-envelope coupling time and with an
account of the tidal synchronization of stellar envelope rotation during the
binary system evolution. The results of our simulations, convolved with the
metallicity-dependent star-formation history, show that the total masses and
effective spins of the merging binary black holes detected during LIGO O1-O2

  Telescope at 5 GHz and the Role of Scintillation","  FRB 121102, the only repeating fast radio burst (FRB) known to date, was
discovered at 1.4 GHz and shortly after the discovery of its repeating nature,
detected up to 2.4 GHz. Here we present three bursts detected with the 100-m
Effelsberg radio telescope at 4.85 GHz. All three bursts exhibited frequency
structure on broad and narrow frequency scales. Using an autocorrelation
function analysis, we measured a characteristic bandwidth of the small-scale
structure of 6.4$\pm$1.6 MHz, which is consistent with the diffractive
scintillation bandwidth for this line of sight through the Galactic
interstellar medium (ISM) predicted by the NE2001 model. These were the only
detections in a campaign totaling 22 hours in 10 observing epochs spanning five
months. The observed burst detection rate within this observation was
inconsistent with a Poisson process with a constant average occurrence rate;
three bursts arrived in the final 0.3 hr of a 2 hr observation on 2016 August
20. We therefore observed a change in the rate of detectable bursts during this
observation, and we argue that boosting by diffractive interstellar
scintillations may have played a role in the detectability. Understanding
whether changes in the detection rate of bursts from FRB 121102 observed at
other radio frequencies and epochs are also a product of propagation effects,
such as scintillation boosting by the Galactic ISM or plasma lensing in the
host galaxy, or an intrinsic property of the burst emission will require
further observations.

trace particle acceleration, powered by magnetic reconnection, shock fronts
(such as formed by coronal mass ejections, CMEs), and magnetospheric currents,
in some cases offering the only window into these processes in stellar
atmospheres. We conducted a 58-hour, ultra-wideband survey for coherent radio
bursts on 5 active M dwarfs. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
to observe simultaneously in three frequency bands covering a subset of 224-482
MHz and 1-6 GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any
observations of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts across 13 epochs,
providing the first large sample of wideband dynamic spectra of stellar
coherent radio bursts. The observed bursts have diverse morphology, with
durations ranging from seconds to hours, but all share strong (40-100%)
circular polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often
associated with CMEs), but we cannot rule out the occurrence of radio-quiet
stellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all polarized in the sense of the
x-mode of the star's large-scale magnetic field, suggesting they are cyclotron
maser emission from electrons accelerated in the large-scale field, analogous
to auroral processes on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous coherent
bursts peaks at 25% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining at lower and higher frequencies,
indicating source regions in the low corona. At these frequencies, active M
dwarfs should be the most common galactic transient source.

spectral modulation: 17 exhibit fine-scale spectral modulation with an rms
exceeding 50% of the mean, with decorrelation bandwidths (half-maximum) ranging

magnitude lower than the $\gtrsim 30\,$MHz expected of Galactic interstellar

that the amplitude of the fine-scale spectral modulation is anti-correlated
with dispersion measure (DM) that would suggest it originates as a propagation
effect. This effect appears to be corroborated by the smoothness of the
higher-DM Parkes FRBs, and could arise due to quenching of diffractive
scintillation (e.g. in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy) by angular
broadening in the intergalactic medium.

contrast to previous works, the high-energy power-law index of the Band model,
$\beta$, has in general a lower value for the single pulses in this work. In
particular, we investigate the individual spectrum in each pulse, that has the
largest value of the low-energy spectral indexes, $\alpha$. For these 38
spectra, we find that 60% of the $\alpha$ values are larger than $-2/3$, and
thus incompatible with synchrotron emission.Finally, we find that the parameter
relations show a variety of behaviours. Most noteworthy is the fact that the
relation between $\alpha$ and the energy flux is similar for most of the
pulses, independent of any evolution of the other parameters.

analyze a wide-frequency-range (1-8 GHz) sample of high-signal-to-noise,
coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo and Green Bank
telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time-frequency structures that include
sub-bursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure
complicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is
appropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse
structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 +/- 0.07
pc/cc at MJD 57644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the
sub-bursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later
times in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1-1.7 GHz band, the ~ 0.5-1-ms
sub-bursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100-400 MHz, and a
characteristic drift rate of ~ 200 MHz/ms towards lower frequencies. At higher
radio frequencies, the sub-burst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on
average. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission
mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium
local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the
literature suggests an increase of Delta(DM) ~ 1-3 pc/cc in 4 years, though
this could be a stochastic variation as opposed to a secular trend. This
implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of
frequency-dependent delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously
proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102 is embedded in a dense nebula.

detected by the Fermi satellite at lower energies, in the 10 keV -- 100 GeV
energy range, up to ~ 50 seconds (i.e. before the MAGIC detection) can hold
valuable information. We analyze the spectral evolution of the emission of GRB

40 MeV energy range up to ~60 sec. The first 4 s of the burst feature a typical
prompt emission spectrum, which can be fit by a smoothly broken power-law
function with typical parameters. Starting on ~4 s post-trigger, we find an
additional nonthermal component, which can be fit by a power law. This
component rises and decays quickly. The 10 keV -- 40 MeV flux of the power-law
component peaks at ~ 6 s; it reaches a value of 1.7e-5 erg cm-2 s-1. The time
of the peak coincides with the emission peak detected by the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi. The power-law spectral slope that we find in
the GBM data is remarkably similar to that of the LAT spectrum, and the GBM+LAT
spectral energy distribution seems to be consistent with a single component.
This suggests that the LAT emission and the power-law component that we find in
the GBM data belong to the same emission component, which we interpret as due
to the afterglow of the burst. The onset time allows us to estimate the initial
jet bulk Lorentz factor Gamma_0 is about 500, depending on the assumed

(FRB 121102). A deep search has allowed us to probe unprecedentedly low burst
energies during two consecutive observations (separated by one day) using the
Arecibo telescope at 1.4 GHz. The bursts are generally detected in less than a
third of the 580-MHz observing bandwidth, demonstrating that narrow-band FRB
signals may be more common than previously thought. We show that the bursts are
likely faint versions of previously reported multi-component bursts. There is a
striking lack of bursts detected below 1.35 GHz and simultaneous VLA
observations at 3 GHz did not detect any of the 41 bursts, but did detect one
that was not seen with Arecibo, suggesting preferred radio emission frequencies
that vary with epoch. A power law approximation of the cumulative distribution
of burst energies yields an index $-1.8\pm0.3$ that is much steeper than the
previously reported value of $\sim-0.7$. The discrepancy may be evidence for a
more complex energy distribution. We place constraints on the possibility that
the associated persistent radio source is generated by the emission of many
faint bursts ($\sim700$ ms$^{-1}$). We do not see a connection between burst
fluence and wait time. The distribution of wait times follows a log-normal
distribution centered around $\sim200$ s; however, some bursts have wait times
below 1 s and as short as 26 ms, which is consistent with previous reports of a
bimodal distribution. We caution against exclusively integrating over the full
observing band during FRB searches, because this can lower signal-to-noise.

ambient solar atmosphere and are believed to be generated by microflare
reconnection.
  Multiple sets of recurrent jets are identified in extreme-ultraviolet filter
imaging. In this work we analyze the long time-scale recurrence of coronal jets
originating from a unique footpoint structure observed in the lower corona. We
report the detection of penumbral magnetic structures in the lower corona.
These structures, that we entitled ""Coronal Geysers"", persist through multiple
reconnection events that trigger recurrent jets in a quasi-periodical trend.
  Recurrent jet eruptions have been associated with Type-III radio bursts that
are manifestations of traveling non-thermal electron beams.We examine the
assumed link, as the coronal sources of interplanetary Type-III bursts are
still open for debate. We scrutinized the hypothesized association by
temporally correlating a statistically significant sample of six Geyser
structures, that released at least 50 recurrent jets, with correspondent
Type-III radio bursts detected in the interplanetary medium.
  Data analysis of these phenomena provides new information towards
understanding of small-scale reconnection, non-thermal electron beam
acceleration, and energy release. We find that the penumbral Geyser-like
flaring structures produce recurring jets. They can be long-lived,
quasi-stable, and act as coronal sources for Type-III bursts and implicitly for
upwards accelerated electron beams.

evolution in an arbitrary research field. In a traditional approach, the paper
collection is first divided into temporal subsets, and then a co-word network
is independently depicted in a 2D map to characterize each period's trend. To
effectively map emerging research trends from such a time-series of co-word
networks, this paper presents TrendNets, a novel visualization methodology that
highlights the rapid changes in edge weights over time. Specifically, we
formulated a new convex optimization framework that decomposes the matrix
constructed from dynamic co-word networks into a smooth part and a sparse part:
the former represents stationary research topics, while the latter corresponds
to bursty research topics. Simulation results on synthetic data demonstrated
that our matrix decomposition approach achieved the best burst detection
performance over four baseline methods. In experiments conducted using papers
published in the past 16 years at three conferences in different fields, we
showed the effectiveness of TrendNets compared to the traditional co-word

  gamma-rays","  Early and late multiwavelength observations play an important role in
determining the nature of the progenitor, circumburst medium, physical
processes and emitting regions associated to the spectral and temporal features
of bursts. GRB 180720B is a long and powerful burst detected by a large number
of observatories in multiwavelenths that range from radio bands to sub-TeV
gamma-rays. The simultaneous multiwavelength observations were presented over
multiple periods of time beginning just after the trigger time and extending
for more than 30 days. The temporal and spectral analysis of Fermi LAT
observations suggests that it presents similar characteristics to other bursts
detected by this instrument. Coupled with X-ray and optical observations, the
standard external-shock model in a homogeneous medium is favored by this
analysis. The X-ray flare is consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
model from the reverse-shock region evolving in a thin shell and long-lived
LAT, X-ray and optical data with the standard synchrotron forward-shock model.
The best-fit parameters derived with the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations
indicate that the outflow is endowed with magnetic fields and that the radio
observations are in the self-absorption regime. The SSC forward-shock model
with our parameters can explain the LAT photons beyond the synchrotron limit as
well as the emission recently reported by the HESS Collaboration.

thousands per day over the entire sky with radiation energy densities at the
source about ten billion times larger than those from Galactic pulsars. We
survey FRB phenomenology, source models and host galaxies, coherent radiation
models, and the role of plasma propagation effects in burst detection. The FRB
field is guaranteed to be exciting: new telescopes will expand the sample from
the current ~80 unique burst sources (and a few secure localizations and
redshifts) to thousands, with burst localizations that enable host-galaxy
redshifts emerging directly from interferometric surveys.
  * FRBs are now established as an extragalactic phenomenon.
  * Only a few sources are known to repeat. Despite the failure to redetect
other FRBs, they are not inconsistent with all being repeaters.
  * FRB sources may be new, exotic kinds of objects or known types in extreme
circumstances. Many inventive models exist, ranging from alien spacecraft to
cosmic strings but those concerning compact objects and supermassive black
holes have gained the most attention. A rapidly rotating magnetar is a
promising explanation for FRB 121102 along with the persistent source
associated with it, but alternative source models are not ruled out for it or
other FRBs.
  * FRBs are powerful tracers of circumsource environments, `missing baryons'
in the IGM, and dark matter.
  * The relative contributions of host galaxies and the IGM to propagation
effects have yet to be disentangled, so dispersion measure distances have large
uncertainties.

  FRB 121102","  We report the detection of a single burst from the first-discovered repeating
Fast Radio Burst source, FRB 121102, with CHIME/FRB, which operates in the
frequency band 400-800 MHz. The detected burst occurred on 2018 November 19 and
its emission extends down to at least 600 MHz, the lowest frequency detection
of this source yet. The burst, detected with a significance of 23.7$\sigma$,
has fluence 12$\pm$3 Jy ms and shows complex time and frequency morphology. The
34 ms width of the burst is the largest seen for this object at any frequency.
We find evidence of sub-burst structure that drifts downward in frequency at a
rate of -3.9$\pm$0.2 MHz ms$^{-1}$. Our best fit tentatively suggests a
dispersion measure of 563.6$\pm$0.5 pc cm$^{-3}$, which is ${\approx}$1% higher
than previously measured values. We set an upper limit on the scattering time
at 500 MHz of 9.6 ms, which is consistent with expectations from the
extrapolation from higher frequency data. We have exposure to the position of
FRB 121102 for a total of 11.3 hrs within the FWHM of the synthesized beams at
600 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 February 25. We estimate on the basis of this
single event an average burst rate for FRB 121102 of 0.1-10 per day in the
400-800 MHz band for a median fluence threshold of 7 Jy ms in the stated time
interval.

low-voltage waveforms, known as inter-bursts, are related to different grades

detection method, developed from preterm infants born <30 weeks of gestational
age, to detect inter-bursts in term infants. Different features from the
temporal organisation of the inter-bursts are combined using a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) machine learning algorithm to classify four grades of injury
in the EEG. We find that the best performing feature, percentage of
inter-bursts, has an accuracy of 59.3%. Combining this with the maximum
duration of inter-bursts in the MLP produces a testing accuracy of 77.8%, with
similar performance to existing multi-feature methods. These results validate
the use of the preterm detection method in term EEG and show how simple
measures of the inter-burst interval can be used to classify different grades

consequently find non-emerging entities since the absence of entities in

novel task of discovering truly emerging entities when they have just been

based on time-sensitive distant supervision, which exploits distinctive
early-stage contexts of emerging entities. Experimental results with a
large-scale Twitter archive show that the proposed method achieves 83.2%
precision of the top 500 discovered emerging entities, which outperforms
baselines based on unseen entity recognition with burst detection. Besides
notable emerging entities, our method can discover massive long-tail and
homographic emerging entities. An evaluation of relative recall shows that the
method detects 80.4% emerging entities newly registered in Wikipedia; 92.4% of

is applied to a well-defined sample of GRBs that is complete in redshift. The
sample is composed of 99 bursts detected by the $Swift$ satellite, 81 of them
with measured redshift and luminosity for a completeness level of $82\%$. We
confirm that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity (with an evolution index
of $\delta=2.22^{+0.32}_{-0.31}$) or in density ($\delta=1.92^{+0.20}_{-0.21}$)
is needed in order to reproduce the observations well. But since the predicted
redshift and luminosity distributions in the two scenarios are very similar, it
is difficult to distinguish between these two kinds of evolutions only on the
basis of the current sample. Furthermore, we also consider an empirical density
case in which the GRB rate density is directly described as a broken power-law
function and the luminosity function is taken to be non-evolving. In this case,
we find that the GRB formation rate rises like $(1+z)^{3.85^{+0.48}_{-0.45}}$
for $z\leq2$ and is proportional to $(1+z)^{-1.07^{+0.98}_{-1.12}}$ for
$z\geq2$. The local GRB rate is $1.49^{+0.63}_{-0.64}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.
The GRB rate may be consistent with the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at

was detected at Nanshan, from which hundreds of bursts were recorded. Perytons
are terrestrial radio signals that mimic celestial fast radio bursts. They were
first reported at Parkes and identified as microwave oven interferences later.
The bursts detected at Nanshan show similar frequency swept emission and have
double-peaked profiles. They appeared in different sky regions in about tens of
minutes observations and the dispersion measure index is not exactly 2, which
indicates the terrestrial origin. The peryton differs drastically from the

binding energy of its compact remnant in the form of neutrinos over an interval
of a few tens of seconds. In the event of a core-collapse supernova within our
galaxy, multiple current and future neutrino detectors would see a large burst
in activity. Neutrinos escape a supernova hours before light does, so any
prompt information about the supernova's direction that can be inferred via the
neutrino signal will help to enable early electromagnetic observations of the
supernova. While there are methods to determine the direction via intrinsic
directionality of some neutrino-matter interaction channels, a complementary
method which will reach maturity with the next generation of large neutrino
detectors is the use of relative neutrino arrival times at different detectors
around the globe. To evaluate this triangulation method for realistic detector
configurations of the next few decades, we generate random supernova neutrino
signals with realistic detector assumptions, and quantify the error in expected
time delay between detections. We investigate a practical and robust method of
estimating the time differences between burst detections, also correcting for
detection efficiency bias. With this method, we determine the pointing
precision of supernova neutrino triangulation as a function of supernova
distance and location, detectors used, detector background level and neutrino
mass ordering assumption. Under favorable conditions, the 1$\sigma$ supernova
search area from triangulation could be reduced to a few percent of the sky. It
should be possible to implement this method with low latency under realistic

the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Large Area Telescope on board the $Fermi$
$Gamma$-$ray$ $Space$ $Telescope$. The $\gamma$-ray prompt emission of GRB
160709A is adequately fitted by combinations of three distinct components: (i)
a nonthermal component described by a power law (PL) with a high-energy
exponential cutoff, (ii) a thermal component modeled with a Planck function,
and (iii) a second nonthermal component shaped by an additional PL crossing the
whole $\gamma$-ray spectrum. While the thermal component dominates during
$\sim$ 0.12 s of the main emission episode of GRB 160709A with an unusually
high temperature of $\sim$ 340 keV, the nonthermal components dominate in the
early and late time. The thermal component is consistent with the photospheric
emission resulting in the following parameters: the size of the central engine,
$R_{0}$ = $3.8 \substack{+5.9 \\ -1.8}$ $\times 10^{8}$ cm, the size of the
photosphere, R$_{ph}$ = $7.4 \substack{+0.8 \\ -1.2}$ $\times 10^{10}$ cm, and
a bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$ = $728 \substack{+75 \\ -93}$ assuming a
redshift of 1. The slope of the additional PL spectrum stays unchanged
throughout the burst duration; however, its flux decreases continuously as a
function of time. A standard external shock model has been tested for the
additional PL component using the relation between the temporal and spectral
indices (the closure relation). Each set of spectral and temporal indices from
two energy bands (200 keV--40 MeV and 100 MeV--10 GeV) satisfies a distinct
closure relation. From the closure relation test we derived the index for the
electron spectral distribution, $p$ = 2.5 $\pm$ 0.1. The interaction of the jet
with the interstellar environment is preferred over the interaction with the
wind medium.

$\pm$1.2~s. These results are consistent with those derived previously from
stacking a large amount of bursts detected by RXTE/PCA within a series of {\bf

well for the first time to infer the burst influence upon the continuum

the finding that hard X-ray shortage appears at around 40 keV in the continuum

(UCXBs), with the purpose of constraining the chemical composition of their
accretion disk and donor star. Our investigation was focused on the presence
(or absence) of the Fe K${\alpha}$ emission line, which was used as the probe
of chemical composition of the disk, based on previously established
theoretical predictions for the reflection of X-ray radiation off the surface
of C/O-rich or He-rich accretion disks in UCXBs. We have contrasted the results
of our spectral analysis to the history of type I X-ray bursts from these
systems, which can also indicate donor star composition. We found that UCXBs
with prominent and persistent iron K${\alpha}$ emission also featured repeat
bursting activity. On the other hand, the UCXBs for which no iron line was
detected, appear to have few or no type I X-ray bursts detected over more than
a decade of monitoring. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a
strong correlation between the Fe K${\alpha}$ line strength and the abundance
of C and O in the accretion disk material and given the expected correlation
between the H/He abundance and the recurrence rate of type I X-ray bursts, we
propose that there is a considerable likelihood that UCXBs with persistent iron
emission have He-rich donors, while those that do not, likely have C/O or
O/Ne/Mg-rich donors. Our results strongly advocate for the development of more

  Observed by Parker Solar Probe","  Radio waves are strongly scattered in the solar wind, so that their apparent
sources seem to be considerably larger and shifted than the actual ones. Since
the scattering depends on the spectrum of density turbulence, better
understanding of the radio wave propagation provides indirect information on
the relative density fluctuations $\epsilon=\langle\delta n\rangle/\langle
n\rangle$ at the effective turbulence scale length. Here, we have analyzed 30
type III bursts detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). For the first time, we
have retrieved type III burst decay times $\tau_{\rm{d}}$ between 1 MHz and 10
MHz thanks to an unparalleled temporal resolution of PSP. We observed a
significant deviation in a power-law slope for frequencies above 1 MHz when
compared to previous measurements below 1 MHz by the twin-spacecraft Solar
TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. We note that altitudes of
radio bursts generated at 1 MHz roughly coincide with an expected location of
the Alfv\'{e}n point, where the solar wind becomes super-Alfv\'{e}nic. By
comparing PSP observations and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict relative
density fluctuations $\epsilon$ at the effective turbulence scale length at
radial distances between 2.5$R_\odot$ and 14$R_\odot$ to range from $0.22$ and
$0.09$. Finally, we calculated relative density fluctuations $\epsilon$
measured in situ by PSP at a radial distance from the Sun of $35.7$~$R_\odot$
during the perihelion \#1, and the perihelion \#2 to be $0.07$ and $0.06$,
respectively. It is in a very good agreement with previous STEREO predictions
($\epsilon=0.06-0.07$) obtained by remote measurements of radio sources
generated at this radial distance.

cooling of the hot inner accretion flow that surrounds the bursting neutron
star. Given that GS 1826-24 remained persistently in the hard state over the
period 2003-2008 and presented regular bursting properties, we stacked the
spectra of the X-ray bursts detected by INTEGRAL (JEM-X and ISGRI) and
XMM-Newton (RGS) during that period to study the effect of the burst photons on
the properties of the Comptonizing medium. The extended energy range provided
by these instruments allows the simultaneous observation of the burst and
persistent emission spectra. We detect an overall change in the shape of the
persistent emission spectrum in response to the burst photon shower. For the
first time, we observe simultaneously a drop in the hard X-ray emission,
together with a soft X-ray excess with respect to the burst blackbody emission.
The hard X-ray drop can be explained by burst-induced coronal cooling, while
the bulk of the soft X-ray excess can be described by fitting the burst
emission with an atmosphere model, instead of a simple blackbody model.
Traditionally, the persistent emission was assumed to be invariant during X-ray
bursts, and more recently to change only in normalization but not in spectral
shape; the observed change in the persistent emission level during X-ray bursts
may thus trigger the revision of existing neutron star mass-radius constraints,
as the derived values rely on the assumption that the persistent emission does
not change during X-ray bursts. The traditional burst fitting technique leads
to up to a 10% overestimation of the bolometric burst flux in GS 1826-24, which
significantly hampers the comparisons of the KEPLER and MESA model against this
'textbook burster'.

  with evolving environment of internal shocks","  GRB 160325A is the only bright burst detected by AstroSat CZT Imager in its
primary field of view to date. In this work, we present the spectral and
polarimetric analysis of the prompt emission of the burst using AstroSat, Fermi
and Niel Gehrels Swift observations. The prompt emission consists of two
distinct emission episodes separated by a few seconds of quiescent/ mild
activity period. The first emission episode shows a thermal component as well
as a low polarisation fraction of $PF < 37\, \%$ at $1.5\, \sigma$ confidence
level. On the other hand, the second emission episode shows a non-thermal
spectrum and is found to be highly polarised with $PF > 43\, \%$ at $1.5
\sigma$ confidence level. We also study the afterglow properties of the jet
using {\it Swift}/XRT data. The observed jet break suggests that the jet is
pointed towards the observer and has an opening angle of $1.2^{\circ}$ for an
assumed redshift, $z = 2$. With composite modelling of polarisation, spectrum
of the prompt emission and the afterglow, we infer that the first episode of
emission originates from the photosphere with localised dissipation happening
below it, and the second from the optically thin region above the photosphere.
The photospheric emission is generated mainly by inverse Compton scattering,
whereas the emission in the optically thin region is produced by the
synchrotron process. The low radiation efficiency of the burst suggests that
the outflow remains baryonic dominated throughout the burst duration with only
a subdominant Poynting flux component, and the kinetic energy of the jet is
likely dissipated via internal shocks which evolves from an optically thick to
optically thin environment within the jet.

fast radio burst FRB 180916, observed at 328 MHz with the Sardinia Radio
Telescope (SRT). The SRT observed the periodic repeater FRB 180916 for five
days from 2020 February 20 to 24 during a time interval of active radio
bursting, and detected the three bursts during the first hour of observations;
no more bursts were detected during the remaining ~ 30 hours. Simultaneous SRT
observations at 1548 MHz did not detect any bursts. Burst fluences are in the
range 37 to 13 Jy ms. No relevant scattering is observed for these bursts. We
also present the results of the multi-wavelength campaign we performed on FRB
180916, during the five days of the active window. Simultaneously with the SRT
observations, others with different time spans were performed with the Northern
Cross at 408 MHz, with XMM-Newton, NICER, INTEGRAL, AGILE, and with the TNG and
two optical telescopes in Asiago, which are equipped with fast photometers.
XMM-Newton obtained data simultaneously with the three bursts detected by the
SRT, and determined a luminosity upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of
~$10^{45}$ erg/s for the burst emission. AGILE obtained data simultaneously
with the first burst and determined a fluence upper limit in the MeV range for
millisecond timescales of $ 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$.Our results show that
absorption from the circumburst medium does not significantly affect the
emission from FRB 180916, thus limiting the possible presence of a
superluminous supernova around the source, and indicate that a cutoff for the
bursting mechanism, if present, must be at lower frequencies. Our
multi-wavelength campaign sensitively constrains the broadband emission from
FRB 180916, and provides the best limits so far for the electromagnetic
response to the radio bursting of this remarkable source of fast radio bursts.

observations revealed a spin period of 1.36 s, soon confirmed by the discovery
of radio pulsations. We report here on the analysis of the Swift burst and
follow-up X-ray and radio observations. The burst average luminosity was
$L_{\rm burst} \sim2\times 10^{39}$ erg/s (at 4.8 kpc). Simultaneous
observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR three days after the burst provided a
source spectrum well fit by an absorbed blackbody ($N_{\rm H} = (1.13\pm0.03)
\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $kT = 1.16\pm0.03$ keV) plus a power-law
($\Gamma=0.0\pm1.3$) in the 1-20 keV band, with a luminosity of
$\sim$$8\times10^{34}$ erg/s, dominated by the blackbody emission. From our
timing analysis, we derive a dipolar magnetic field $B \sim 7\times10^{14}$ G,
spin-down luminosity $\dot{E}_{\rm rot} \sim 1.4\times10^{36}$ erg/s and
characteristic age of 240 yr, the shortest currently known. Archival
observations led to an upper limit on the quiescent luminosity
$<$$5.5\times10^{33}$ erg/s, lower than the value expected from magnetar
cooling models at the source characteristic age. A 1 hr radio observation with
the Sardinia Radio Telescope taken about 1 week after the X-ray burst detected
a number of strong and short radio pulses at 1.5 GHz, in addition to regular
pulsed emission; they were emitted at an average rate 0.9 min$^{-1}$ and
accounted for $\sim$50% of the total pulsed radio fluence. We conclude that
Swift ,J1818.0-1607 is a peculiar magnetar belonging to the small, diverse
group of young neutron stars with properties straddling those of rotationally
and magnetically powered pulsars. Future observations will make a better
estimation of the age possible by measuring the spin-down rate in quiescence.

after the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a binary neutron star (BNS)
merger. It is now understood as an off-axis event powered by the cocoon of a
relativistic jet pointing 15 to 30 degrees away from the direction of
observation. The cocoon was energized by the interaction of the incipient jet
with the non-relativistic baryon wind from the merger remnant, resulting in a
structured outflow with a narrow core and broad wings. In this paper, we couple
the observational constraints on the structured outflow with a model for the
jet-wind interaction to constrain the intrinsic properties with which the jet
was launched by the central engine, including its time delay from the merger
event. Using wind prescriptions inspired by magnetized BNS merger simulations,
we find that the jet was launched within about 0.4 s from the merger, implying
that the 1.74 s observed delay was dominated by the fireball propagation up to
the photospheric radius. We also constrain, for the first time for any
gamma-ray burst, the jet opening angle at injection and set a lower limit to
its asymptotic Lorentz factor. These findings suggest an initially
Poynting-flux dominated jet, launched via electromagnetic processes. If the jet
was powered by an accreting black hole, they also provide a significant
constraint on the survival time of the metastable neutron star remnant.

characteristic pattern of EEG activity during quiet sleep in term neonates-is
defined by alternating periods of short-duration, high-voltage activity
(bursts) separated by lower-voltage activity (inter-bursts). This study
presents a novel approach for detecting TA activity by first detecting the
inter-bursts and then processing the temporal map of the bursts and
inter-bursts. EEG recordings from 72 healthy term neonates were used to develop
and evaluate performance of 1) an inter-burst detection method which is then
used for 2) detection of TA activity. First, multiple amplitude and spectral
features were combined using a support vector machine (SVM) to classify bursts
from inter-bursts within TA activity, resulting in a median area under the
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.93
to 0.98). Second, post-processing of the continuous SVM output, the confidence
score, was used to produce a TA envelope. This envelope was used to detect TA
activity within the continuous EEG with a median AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80 to
0.88). These results validate how an inter-burst detection approach combined
with post processing can be used to classify TA activity. Detecting the
presence or absence of TA will help quantify disruption of the clinically
important sleep-wake cycle.

fluence of $\sim10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ were detected by the IBIS
instrument in the 20-200 keV range. The burst with the hardest spectrum,
discovered and localized in real time by the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System, was
spatially and temporally coincident with a short and very bright radio burst
detected by the CHIME and STARE2 radio telescopes at 400-800 MHz and 1.4 GHz,
respectively. Its lightcurve shows three narrow peaks separated by $\sim$29 ms
time intervals, superimposed on a broad pulse lasting $\sim$0.6 s. The
brightest peak had a delay of 6.5$\pm$1.0 ms with respect to the 1.4 GHz radio
pulse (that coincides with the second and brightest component seen at lower
frequencies). The burst spectrum, an exponentially cut-off power law with
photon index $\Gamma=0.7_{-0.2}^{+0.4}$ and peak energy $E_p=65\pm5$ keV, is
harder than those of the bursts usually observed from this and other magnetars.
By the analysis of an expanding dust scattering ring seen in X-rays with the
{\it Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} XRT instrument, we derived a distance of
4.4$_{-1.3}^{+2.8}$ kpc for SGR 1935+2154, independent of its possible
association with the supernova remnant G57.2+0.8. At this distance, the burst
20-200 keV fluence of $(6.1\pm 0.3)\times10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ corresponds to
an isotropic emitted energy of $\sim1.4\times10^{39}$ erg. This is the first
burst with a radio counterpart observed from a soft $\gamma$-ray repeater and
it strongly supports models based on magnetars that have been proposed for
extragalactic fast radio bursts.

fields ($B$ $\approx$ $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ G) and longer rotational periods ($P$
$\approx$ 1-12 s) than ordinary pulsars. In contrast to rotation-powered
pulsars, magnetar emission is thought to be fueled by the evolution and decay
of their powerful magnetic fields. They display highly variable radio and X-ray
emission, but the processes responsible for this behavior remain a mystery. We
report the discovery of bright, persistent individual X-ray pulses from XTE
J1810-197, a transient radio magnetar, using the Neutron star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER) following its recent radio reactivation. Similar
behavior has only been previously observed from a magnetar during short time
periods following a giant flare. However, the X-ray pulses presented here were
detected outside of a flaring state. They are less energetic and display
temporal structure that differs from the impulsive X-ray events previously
observed from the magnetar class, such as giant flares and short X-ray bursts.
Our high frequency radio observations of the magnetar, carried out
simultaneously with the X-ray observations, demonstrate that the relative
alignment between the X-ray and radio pulses varies on rotational timescales.
No correlation was found between the amplitudes or temporal structure of the
X-ray and radio pulses. The magnetar's 8.3 GHz radio pulses displayed frequency
structure, which was not observed in the pulses detected simultaneously at 31.9
GHz. Many of the radio pulses were also not detected simultaneously at both
frequencies, which indicates that the underlying emission mechanism producing
these pulses is not broadband. We find that the radio pulses from XTE J1810-197
share similar characteristics to radio bursts detected from fast radio burst
(FRB) sources, some of which are now thought to be produced by active
magnetars.

from enigmatic sources at extragalactic distances so far lacking a detection in
other energy bands. Magnetized neutron stars (magnetars) have been considered
as the sources powering the FRBs, but the connection is controversial because
of differing energetics and the lack of radio and X-ray detections with similar
characteristics in the two classes. We report here the detection by the AGILE
satellite on April 28, 2020 of an X-ray burst in coincidence with the very
bright radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The burst detected
by AGILE in the hard X-ray band (18-60 keV) lasts about 0.5 seconds, it is
spectrally cutoff above 80 keV, and implies an isotropically emitted energy ~
$10^{40}$ erg. This event is remarkable in many ways: it shows for the first
time that a magnetar can produce X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB-like
radio bursts; it also suggests that FRBs associated with magnetars may emit
X-ray bursts of both magnetospheric and radio-pulse types that may be
discovered in nearby sources. Guided by this detection, we discuss SGR
1935+2154 in the context of FRBs, and especially focus on the class of
repeating-FRBs. Based on energetics, magnetars with fields B ~ $10^{15}$ G may
power the majority of repeating-FRBs. Nearby repeating-FRBs offer a unique
occasion to consolidate the FRB-magnetar connection, and we present new data on
the X-ray monitoring of nearby FRBs. Our detection enlightens and constrains
the physical process leading to FRBs: contrary to previous expectations,
high-brightness temperature radio emission coexists with spectrally-cutoff
X-ray radiation.

  Radio Bursts","  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-scale radio pulses, which originate
in distant galaxies and are produced by unknown sources. The mystery remains
partially because of the typical difficulty in localising FRBs to host
galaxies. Accurate localisations delivered by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP
Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey now provide an opportunity to study the host
galaxies and potential transient counterparts of FRBs at a large range of
wavelengths. In this work, we investigate whether the first three FRBs
accurately localised by CRAFT have supernova-like transient counterparts. We
obtained two sets of imaging epochs with the Very Large Telescope for three
host galaxies, one soon after the burst detection and one several months later.
After subtracting these images no optical counterparts were identified in the
associated FRB host galaxies, so we instead place limits on the brightness of
any potential optical transients. A Monte Carlo approach, in which supernova
light curves were modelled and their base properties randomised, was used to
estimate the probability of a supernova associated with each FRB going
undetected. We conclude that Type Ia and IIn supernovae are unlikely to
accompany every apparently non-repeating FRB.

  1935+2154","  Using numerical simulations we show that low-amplitude Alfv\'en waves from a
magnetar quake propagate to the outer magnetosphere and convert to ""plasmoids""
(closed magnetic loops) which accelerate from the star, driving blast waves
into the magnetar wind. Quickly after its formation, the plasmoid becomes a
thin relativistic pancake. It pushes out the magnetospheric field lines, and
they gradually reconnect behind the pancake, generating a variable wind far
stronger than the normal spindown wind of the magnetar. Repeating ejections
drive blast waves in the amplified wind. We suggest that these ejections
generate the simultaneous X-ray and radio bursts detected from SGR 1935+2154. A
modest energy budget of the magnetospheric perturbation $\sim 10^{40}$ erg is
sufficient to produce the observed bursts. Our simulation predicts a narrow (a
few ms) X-ray spike from the magnetosphere, arriving almost simultaneously with
the radio burst emitted far outside the magnetosphere. This timing is caused by
the extreme relativistic motion of the ejecta.

  flares from SGR1935+2154 with Palomar Gattini-IR","  The Galactic magnetar SGR1935+2154 has been reported to produce the first
known example of a bright millisecond duration radio burst (FRB 200428) similar
to the cosmological population of fast radio bursts (FRBs), bolstering the
association of FRBs to active magnetars. The detection of a coincident bright
X-ray burst has revealed the first observed multi-wavelength counterpart of a
FRB. However, the search for similar emission at optical wavelengths has been
hampered by the high inferred extinction on the line of sight. Here, we present
results from the first search for second-timescale emission from the source at
near-infrared wavelengths using the Palomar Gattini-IR observing system in
J-band, made possible by a recently implemented detector read-out mode that
allowed for short exposure times of 0.84 s with 99.9% observing efficiency.
With a total observing time of 12 hours (47728 images) on source, we place
median $3\,\sigma$ limits on the second-timescale emission of $< 20$ mJy (13.1
AB mag). We present non-detection limits from epochs of four simultaneous X-ray
bursts detected by the Insight-{\it HXMT} and {\it NuSTAR} telescopes during
our observing campaign. The limits translate to an extinction corrected fluence
limit of $< 125$ Jy ms for an estimated extinction of $A_J = 2.0$ mag. These
limits provide the most stringent constraints to date on the fluence of flares
at frequencies of $\sim 10^{14}$ Hz, and constrain the ratio of the
near-infrared (NIR) fluence to that of coincident X-ray bursts to $R_{\rm NIR}
< 2.5 \times 10^{-2}$. Our observations were sensitive enough to easily detect
a near-infrared counterpart of FRB 200428 if the NIR emission falls on the same
power law as that observed across its radio to X-ray spectrum. The
non-detection of NIR emission around the coincident X-ray bursts constrains the
fluence index of the brightest burst to be steeper than $0.35$.

  distribution","  Detections from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 are clustered in
time, noticeable even in the earliest repeat bursts. Recently, it was argued
that the source activity is periodic, suggesting that the clustering reflected
a not-yet-identified periodicity. We performed an extensive multi-wavelength
campaign with the Effelsberg telescope, the Green Bank telescope and the
Arecibo Observatory to shadow the Gran Telescope Canaria (optical), NuSTAR
(X-ray) and INTEGRAL (gamma-ray). We detected 36 bursts with Effelsberg, one
with a pulse width of 39\,ms, the widest burst ever detected from FRB 121102.
With one burst detected during simultaneous NuSTAR observations, we place a
5-$\sigma$ upper limit of $5\times10^{47}$ erg on the 3--79\,keV energy of an
X-ray burst counterpart. We tested the periodicity hypothesis using 165-hr of
Effelsberg observations and find a periodicity of 161$\pm$5 days. We predict
the source to be active from 2020-07-09 to 2020-10-14 and subsequently from
2020-12-17 to 2021-03-24. We compare the wait times between consecutive bursts
within a single observation to Weibull and Poisson distributions. We conclude
that the strong clustering was indeed a consequence of a periodic activity and
show that if the few events with millisecond separation are excluded, the
arrival times are Poisson distributed. We model the bursts' cumulative energy
distribution with energies from ${\sim}10^{38}$-$10^{39}$ erg and find that it
is well described by a power-law with slope of $\gamma=-1.1\pm 0.2$. We propose
that a single power-law might be a poor descriptor of the data over many orders
of magnitude.

sensitive searches for repetitions from bursts detected with the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) with the 64-m Parkes radio telescope,

bandwidth of just 65 MHz. We find no evidence of any emission in the remaining
part of the 3.3 GHz UWL band. While the emission bandwidths of the ASKAP and
UWL bursts show $\nu^{-4}$ scaling consistent with a propagation effect, the
spectral occupancy is inconsistent with diffractive scintillation. This
detection rules out models predicting broad-band emission from the FRB

low spectral occupancy highlights the importance of sub-banded search methods

frequency and energy of impulsive events in the outer solar atmosphere in an
attempt to understand the predominant energy supply mechanism in the corona.
Here, we apply a burst detection algorithm to high-resolution imaging data
obtained by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph to further investigate
the derived power-law index, $\gamma$, of bright impulsive events in the
transition region. Applying the algorithm with a constant minimum event
lifetime (of either $60$ s or $110$ s) indicated that the target under
investigation, such as Plage and Sunspot, has an influence on the observed
power-law index. For regions dominated by sunspots, we always find $\gamma <2$;
however, for datasets where the target is a plage region, we often find that
$\gamma >2$ in the energy range [$\sim10^{23}$, $\sim10^{26}$] erg. Applying
the algorithm with a minimum event lifetime of three timesteps indicated that
cadence was another important factor, with the highest cadence datasets
returning $\gamma >2$ values. The estimated total radiative power obtained for
the observed energy distributions is typically 10-25 % of what would be
required to sustain the corona indicating that impulsive events in this energy
range are not sufficient to solve coronal heating. If we were to extend the
power-law distribution down to an energy of $10^{21}$ erg, and assume parity
between radiative energy release and the deposition of thermal energy, then
such bursts could provide 25-50 % of the required energy to account for the
coronal heating problem.

recently confirmed as originating from the Galactic magnetar soft gamma
repeater (SGR) SGR J1935+2154. Just before and after FRB 200428 was detected,
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) had been
monitoring SGR J1935+2154 for eight hours. From UTC 2020 April 27 23:55:00 to
2020 April 28 00:50:37, FAST detected no pulsed radio emission from SGR
J1935+2154, while Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor registered 34 bursts in the
X/soft $\gamma$-ray band, forming a unique sample of X-ray bursts in the
absence of FRBs. After a comprehensive analysis on light curves,
time-integrated, and time-resolved spectral properties of these FRB-absent
X-ray bursts, we compare this sample with the FRB-associated X-ray burst
detected by Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL, and Konus-Wind. The FRB-associated burst
distinguishes itself from other X-ray bursts by its nonthermal spectrum and a
higher spectral peak energy, but otherwise is not atypical. We also compare the
cumulative energy distribution of our X-ray burst sample with that of first
repeating FRB source, FRB 121102, with the calibration of FRB 200428-X-ray
burst association. We find a similarity between the two, offering indirect
support of the magnetar origin of cosmological FRBs. The event rate density of
magnetar bursts is about $\sim 150$ times higher than the FRB event rate
density at the energy of FRB 200428. This again suggests that, if all FRBs
originate from magnetars, only a small fraction of X-ray bursts are associated
with FRBs.

exceptionally high and variable Faraday rotation measure (RM), which must be
imparted within its host galaxy and likely by or within its local environment.
In the redshifted ($z=0.193$) source reference frame, the RM decreased from
$1.46\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ to $1.33\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ between January
and August 2017, showing day-timescale variations of $\sim200$~rad~m$^{-2}$.
Here we present sixteen FRB 121102 RMs from burst detections with the Arecibo
305-m radio telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array, providing a record of FRB 121102's RM over a 2.5-year timespan. Our
observations show a decreasing trend in RM, although the trend is not linear,
dropping by an average of 15\% year$^{-1}$ and is
$\sim9.7\times10^4$~rad~m$^{-2}$ at the most recent epoch of August 2019.
Erratic, short-term RM variations of $\sim10^3$~rad~m$^{-2}$ week$^{-1}$ were
also observed between MJDs 58215--58247. A decades-old neutron star embedded
within a still-compact supernova remnant or a neutron star near a massive black
hole and its accretion torus have been proposed to explain the high RMs. We
compare the observed RMs to theoretical models describing the RM evolution for
FRBs originating within a supernova remnant. FRB 121102's age is unknown, and
we find that the models agree for source ages of $\sim6-17$~years at the time
of the first available RM measurements in 2017. We also draw comparisons to the
decreasing RM of the Galactic center magnetar, PSR J1745--2900.

proposed as progenitors of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). In this
scenario, bursts originate from the interaction between a young magnetar and
its surrounding supernova remnant (SNR). Such a model could explain the
repeating, apparently non-Poissonian nature of FRB121102, which appears to
display quiescent and active phases. This bursting behaviour is better
explained with a Weibull distribution, which includes parametrisation for
clustering. We observed 10 SLSNe/LGRBs for 63 hours, looking for repeating FRBs
with the Effelsberg-100 m radio telescope, but have not detected any bursts. We
scale the burst rate of FRB121102 to an FRB121102-like source inhabiting each
of our observed targets, and compare this rate to our upper burst rate limit on
a source by source basis. By adopting a fiducial beaming fraction of 0.6, we
obtain 99.99\% and 83.4\% probabilities that at least one, and at least half of
our observed sources are beamed towards us respectively. One of our SLSN
targets, PTF10hgi, is coincident with a persistent radio source, making it a
possible analogue to FRB121102. We performed further observations on this
source using the Effelsberg-100~m and Parkes-64~m radio telescopes. Assuming
that PTF10hgi contains an FRB121102-like source, the probabilities of not
detecting any bursts from a Weibull distribution during our observations are
14\% and 16\% for Effelsberg and Parkes respectively. We conclude by showing
that a survey of many short observations increases burst detection probability
for a source with Weibull distributed bursting activity.

magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one X-ray burst. This suggests that magnetars
can make FRBs. On the other hand, the majority of X-ray bursts from SGR
J1935+2154 are not associated with FRBs. One possible reason for such rarity of
FRB-SGR-burst associations is that the FRB emission is much more narrowly
beamed than the SGR burst emission. If such an interpretation is correct, one
would expect to detect radio bursts with viewing angles somewhat outside the
narrow emission beam. These ""slow"" radio bursts (SRBs) would have broader
widths and lower flux densities due to the smaller Doppler factor involved. We
derive two ""closure relations"" to judge whether a long, less luminous radio
burst could be an SRB. The 2.2-s, 308 Jy ms, 111 MHz radio burst detected from
SGR J1935+2154 by the BSA LPI radio telescope may be such an SRB. The 2-ms, 60
mJy ms faint burst detected by FAST from the same source could be also an SRB
if the corresponding FRB has a narrow spectrum. If the FRB beam is narrow,
there should be many more SRBs than FRBs from Galactic magnetars. The lack of
detection of abundant SRBs from magnetars would disfavor the hypothesis that
all SGR bursts are associated with narrow-beam FRBs.

Telescopes have been recently announced: GRB 190114C, detected by MAGIC, GRB
180720B and GRB 190829A, observed by H.E.S.S. A dedicated search for neutrinos
in space and time coincidence with the gamma-ray emission observed by IACTs has
been performed using ANTARES data. The search covers both the prompt and
afterglow phases, yielding no neutrinos in coincidence with the three GRBs
studied. Upper limits on the energetics of the neutrino emission are inferred.
The resulting upper limits are several orders of magnitude above the observed

Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment's Fast Radio Burst backend (CHIME/FRB).
These sources were first identified via single pulses in CHIME/FRB, then
followed up with CHIME/Pulsar. Four sources appear to be rotating radio
transients (RRATs), pulsar-like sources with occasional single pulse emission
with an underlying periodicity. Of those four sources, three have detected
periods ranging from 220 ms to 2.726 s. Three sources have more persistent but
still intermittent emission and are likely intermittent or nulling pulsars. We
have determined phase-coherent timing solutions for the latter three. These
seven sources are the first discovery of previously unknown Galactic sources
with CHIME/FRB and highlight the potential of fast radio burst detection
instruments to search for intermittent Galactic radio sources.

  Space Weather","  Studies of solar radio bursts play an important role in understanding the
dynamics and acceleration processes behind solar space weather events, and the
influence of solar magnetic activity on solar system planets. Similar
low-frequency bursts detected from active M-dwarfs are expected to probe their
space weather environments and therefore the habitability of their planetary
companions. Active M-dwarfs produce frequent, powerful flares which, along with
radio emission, reveal conditions within their atmospheres. However, to date,
only one candidate solar-like coherent radio burst has been identified from
these stars, preventing robust observational constraints on their space weather
environment. During simultaneous optical and radio monitoring of the nearby
dM5.5e star Proxima Centauri, we detected a bright, long-duration optical
flare, accompanied by a series of intense, coherent radio bursts. These
detections include the first example of an interferometrically detected
coherent stellar radio burst temporally coincident with a flare, strongly
indicating a causal relationship between these transient events. The
polarization and temporal structure of the trailing long-duration burst enable
us to identify it as a type IV burst. This represents the most compelling
detection of a solar-like radio burst from another star to date. Solar type IV
bursts are strongly associated with space weather events such as coronal mass
ejections and solar energetic particle events, suggesting that stellar type IV
bursts may be used as a tracer of stellar coronal mass ejections. We discuss
the implications of this event for the occurrence of coronal mass ejections
from Proxima Cen and other active M-dwarfs.

  bursts in the repeating FRB 121102","  The nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is currently unknown. Repeating FRBs
offer better opportunity than non-repeating FRBs since their simultaneous
multi-wavelength counterparts might be identified. The magnetar flare model of
FRBs is one of the most promising models which predicts high energy emission in
addition to radio burst emission. To investigate such a possibility, we have
searched for simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous short-term hard X-ray bursts
in all the Swift/BAT event mode data which covered the periods when fast radio
bursts were reported detections in the repeating FRB 121102, by making use of
BAT's arcmin level spacial resolution and wide field-of-view. We did not find
any significant hard X-ray bursts which occurred simultaneously to those radio
bursts. We also investigated potential short X-ray bursts occurred
quasi-simultaneous with those radio bursts (occurrence time differs in the
range from hundreds of seconds to thousands of seconds) and concluded that even
the best candidates are consistent with background fluctuations. Therefore our
investigation concluded that there were no hard X-ray bursts detectable with
Swift/BAT which occurred simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously with those fast
radio bursts in the repeating FRB 121102.

  Fermi} Data: Evidence of Bulk Acceleration in Prompt Emission","  When a GRB emitter stops emission abruptly, the observer would receive
rapidly fading emission from high latitudes with respect to the line of sight,
known as the ""curvature effect"". Identifying such emission from GRB prompt
emission lightcurves would constrain the radius of prompt emission from the
central engine and the composition of GRB jets. We perform a dedicated search
of high-latitude emission (HLE) through spectral and temporal analyses of a
sample of single-pulse bursts detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on-board
the {\it Fermi} satellite. We identify HLE from a sub-sample of bursts and
constrain the emission radius to be $R_{\rm GRB} \sim (10^{15}-10^{16})$ cm
from the central engine. Some bursts have the HLE decays faster than predicted
by a constant Lorentz factor jet, suggesting that the emission region is
undergoing acceleration during prompt emission. This supports the
Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition for these bursts. The conclusion is
consistent with previous results drawn from spectral-lag modeling of prompt
emission and HLE analysis of X-ray flares.
